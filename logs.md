# Day 1
Four of them were invited to the pumpkin farm house of Madryck. An old man. The house is made out of a house sized pumpkin. The house is cozy. Zybilna is his patron and Madryck knows that these four have lost something at the carnival. He has lost contact with Zybilna. Madryck wants them to find someone named Prismir stuck in the feywild.
Zybilna is an archfey, which is considered a fairy godmother among her followers. Casimir claims to have met her. Alexandra has a book that speaks to Zybilna. Kadayif is strange. Oswald does not know what could be dangerous about the feywild.
Normally Madryck would communicate with Zybilna about the safety of the feywild.
Madryck summoned a carrige for them to take them to the carnival. Fey don't accept gold currency so to speak. The carrige is carved from a pumpkin but not slimy inside.
The carnival's owners are from shadowfell.

Meanwhile, at sunset, I am in a flying carriage as part
Pineham and someone have sent me a letter.
Pineham's letter let me know that my niece lost her tooth. Penelope feels like she is indebted to the tooth-fairy.
The other letter is looking for my help.

Mr. Witch and Mr. Light pull up next to my trailer. Mr. Witch wants my help. He invites me into his and Mr. Light's trailer and asks for my discretion. The two have been having problems with a disgruntled female Kenku guest. She's been using disguises and learned to recognize our security. She has been sabotaging rides and generally ruining guests' experiences. Mr. Light wants Oroonoko and I to blend in and attempt to intercept the kenku guest. He also wants us to not tell anyone about it.  
Thaco came by while Oroonoko and I were preparing to enter the carnival and told me that Palasha and Candlefoot has split up after she proposed. Oroonoko and I waited around the entrance to the park keeping an eye out for groups of four.

Just before the dawn, a Witchlight monarch will be appointed to the person who has contributed the most to the carnival.

There is a new attraction, the lightning dome, where guests can safely fight demons. It is near the entrance.

I caught one of the welcome gifts. Eventually I spotted a group of four travelers and introduced myself by asking if they recognize the Madryck Roslof. They did and I am assisting them. I told them about the Mystery Mine. Zephixo the dwarf runs this.
There is a rail line with carts with seats for 8. We are riding the carts with another couple. The rail line goes into a dragon mouth. Inside their were visions of snakes everywhere! There was also a vision of Alexandra's son dressed as a town guard. Suddenly, I'm in my underwear and everyone is laughing at me, it's terrifying. Then a couple of thugs, ordered by a stately dressed woman to attack us. One more vision appears. The shadow of a woman, dressed as an acrobat. Lights on the ride go out and people scream. Zephixo yells "It's not supposed to do this, I'll try rebooting it". He also recommends Tasha's Fortuneteller.

The booth is a wooden, mechanical dummy. Tasha is a witch-queen who wrote the Demonomicon. Fortune-telling is out of character for her. A halfling couple, in front of us, proposes and the recipient starting rolling on the ground laughing. The proposer ran into the nearby hall of illusions to hide out of embarrassment. Kadayif discovered that perhaps the proposee was magically induced to laugh. Inside the hall of illusions is a series of mirrors which initially reflect our childlike appearances. Later in the maze, our reflections get older. We found the proposer looking at a mirror with a little girl in a pig-mask looking back at him. The proposer is named Rueben. Eventually they meet back up outside the hall and make amends.
With that complete, we all approached the booth to get a fortune but fell under a laughing spell. Still got a fortune though: an embossed card "Scabbatha Nightshade and can't remember the first creature she sees when she wakes up"

After we all got our weird fortunes we headed towards the lost property booth to look for the things we have lost. We met Dirlagraun outside the lost property. Dirlagraun loves children and children love playing with her. One child runs away. We chased the child and spotted the girl in the pig-mask. She says her name is Sow-pig. Her skin is cold and blue-grey. She says "I can't take anything from you, you've got a ticket."

Back at lost-and-found, Dirlagraun apologizes for spooking the child who ran. The child had picked up a ball that belonged to her lost child, Star. We told her that we would help find Star in the feywild.
