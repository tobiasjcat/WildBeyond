# Day 1
Four of them were invited to the pumpkin farm house of Madryck. An old man. The house is made out of a house sized pumpkin. The house is cozy. Zybilna is his patron and Madryck knows that these four have lost something at the carnival. He has lost contact with Zybilna. Madryck wants them to find someone named Prismir stuck in the feywild.
Zybilna is an archfey, which is considered a fairy godmother among her followers. Casimir claims to have met her. Alexandra has a book that speaks to Zybilna. Kadayif is strange. Oswald does not know what could be dangerous about the feywild.
Normally Madryck would communicate with Zybilna about the safety of the feywild.
Madryck summoned a carrige for them to take them to the carnival. Fey don't accept gold currency so to speak. The carrige is carved from a pumpkin but not slimy inside.
The carnival's owners are from shadowfell.

Meanwhile, at sunset, I am in a flying carriage as part
Pineham and someone have sent me a letter.
Pineham's letter let me know that my niece lost her tooth. Penelope feels like she is indebted to the tooth-fairy.
The other letter is looking for my help.

Mr. Witch and Mr. Light pull up next to my trailer. Mr. Witch wants my help. He invites me into his and Mr. Light's trailer and asks for my discretion. The two have been having problems with a disgruntled female Kenku guest. She's been using disguises and learned to recognize our security. She has been sabotaging rides and generally ruining guests' experiences. Mr. Light wants Oroonoko and I to blend in and attempt to intercept the kenku guest. He also wants us to not tell anyone about it.  
Thaco came by while Oroonoko and I were preparing to enter the carnival and told me that Palasha and Candlefoot has split up after she proposed. Oroonoko and I waited around the entrance to the park keeping an eye out for groups of four.

Just before the dawn, a Witchlight monarch will be appointed to the person who has contributed the most to the carnival.

There is a new attraction, the lightning dome, where guests can safely fight demons. It is near the entrance.

I caught one of the welcome gifts. Eventually I spotted a group of four travelers and introduced myself by asking if they recognize the Madryck Roslof. They did and I am assisting them. I told them about the Mystery Mine. Zephixo the dwarf runs this.
There is a rail line with carts with seats for 8. We are riding the carts with another couple. The rail line goes into a dragon mouth. Inside their were visions of snakes everywhere! There was also a vision of Alexandra's son dressed as a town guard. Suddenly, I'm in my underwear and everyone is laughing at me, it's terrifying. Then a couple of thugs, ordered by a stately dressed woman to attack us. One more vision appears. The shadow of a woman, dressed as an acrobat. Lights on the ride go out and people scream. Zephixo yells "It's not supposed to do this, I'll try rebooting it". He also recommends Tasha's Fortuneteller.

The booth is a wooden, mechanical dummy. Tasha is a witch-queen who wrote the Demonomicon. Fortune-telling is out of character for her. A halfling couple, in front of us, proposes and the recipient starting rolling on the ground laughing. The proposer ran into the nearby hall of illusions to hide out of embarrassment. Kadayif discovered that perhaps the proposee was magically induced to laugh. Inside the hall of illusions is a series of mirrors which initially reflect our childlike appearances. Later in the maze, our reflections get older. We found the proposer looking at a mirror with a little girl in a pig-mask looking back at him. The proposer is named Rueben. Eventually they meet back up outside the hall and make amends.
With that complete, we all approached the booth to get a fortune but fell under a laughing spell. Still got a fortune though: an embossed card "Scabbatha Nightshade and can't remember the first creature she sees when she wakes up"

After we all got our weird fortunes we headed towards the lost property booth to look for the things we have lost. We met Dirlagraun outside the lost property. Dirlagraun loves children and children love playing with her. One child runs away.

We chased the child and spotted the girl in the pig-mask. She says her name is Sow-pig. Her skin is cold and blue-grey. She says "I can't take anything from you, you've got a ticket."

Back at lost-and-found, Dirlagraun apologizes for spooking the child who ran. The child had picked up a ball that belonged to her lost child, Star. We told her that we would help find Star in the feywild.
<hr>

Next stop Calliope. A goblin dressed as a ladybug shakes a cup at us. Ernest the Monkey is playing the instrument. I and Oswald gave him buttons. The Calliope plays music that reflects the mood of the carnival. Ernest is in the body of his trained monkey Bubbles. Bubbles has the body. The body may be balding. Suddenly the Calliope starts playing discordant notes along with the regular notes. The discordant notes stop for a second and a person hiding in the shadows begins to run. I tripped them telekinetically and Oswald grabbed em. The target looks human but patting her down I felt feathers. It's the rebellious kenku who has been causing problems! She says she's on a mission to find her mission patron Zybilna. Her name is Kettlesteam. She wanted to cause a ruckus until the owners show her how to get to the feywild. We released her under the understanding that she would return after the big-top extravaganza.

We were on the way to the feasting grounds when we passed a commotion at the Carousel. Diana Cloppington the centaur, is complaining the Carousel won't stop. She's quite upset that she can't fit onto the ride. Diana told Alexandra that she made a deal with a hag to be reunited with her lost warhorse and that's how she ended up as a centaur. A few of us forced our way to the center of the Carousel and were able to stop the gear mechanism to stop the Carousel. Diana told us that the unicorns on the Carousel were made by a hag and have powers of divination. If we name the unicorns we can talk to them. Four of them are partially named. Alexandra immediately figured out their names and we started riding them. They whispered mysterious things at us. Mine whispered with Oswald "Scabbatha Nightshade, granny Nightshade to some. Has the things we seek, you must find her to get your things back. Her lair is a dead hollowed out tree in a sylvan forest. She's part of the hourglass coven with her sisters who she hates but needs." Diana tends to our wounds before we go.

We arrive a the feasting orchard. The trees have fruit. There is a fairycake eating contest going on. Craig from goblin wresting is competing as well. Alexandra won after beating me out by a single cupcake. Overall we ate more than 40 cupcakes.

After recovering from our cupcake feast, we went to the dragonfly rides. Northwind the treent told us that Thaco used to be a knife thrower and Mr. Light and Mr. Witch traded the carnival for something. A dwarf falls from his dragonfly during the ride but Casamir cast feather fall on the dwarf and landed softly on the ground. On the dragonfly, I noticed Kettlesteam by the dragonfly rides. I spotted the moon-masked woman/ghost again.

Next to the Gondola Swans. The swans are giant and pulling 8 person boats. The boat going slowly around the entire park. The swan asks if we are enjoying the "swandolas". Her name is Featherine. She told us about how sad it is that Candlefoot and Palasha broke up. Candlefoot hasn't spoken sense. Kadayif spotted the flog/girl/ghost.

<hr>
Be sure to fix Candlefoot's relationship for mirth points.

The Big Top Extravaganza is about to begin. As we headed over there Casamir ran into an elf wearing a poorly fitting suit. Tintagel is nervous about his first performance on the Big Top Extravaganza. Tintagel invites us into the dressing room. A thin elven man, Mr. Light, is wearing a suit of mirrors. Mr Light is concerned with performers dropping out. Mr Light. Burley is there too.
We signed up to fill in some of the acts by live acting Alexandra's fairy tails.
Oswald and I were in a unicorn costume riding a tandem bicycle.
Burly wants us to meet up after the performance.
The first performer did a very impressive fire-breathing act.
Next up was Candlefoot, a lanky mime. He does sleight of hand tricks and people enjoy it. He does copper-into-gold, coin-into-goldfish and goldfish-into-bigger-fish.
Tintagel goes next. Takes a rabbit out of a hat, and is very nervous. I volunteered to be sawed in half. It went flawlessly and Tintagel forgot to ask for a the potion of revivify he gave me back.
Bugbear lifts several people on a dumb-bell. He then does tug of war with Oswald and I.
Our performance went well.

Afterwards Burly says he'll lead us to Mr. Lights room to pick out payment in. Burly doesn't know where the entrance to the feywild is but thinks his brother is there. Burly says that if we stole Mr Witch's pocket-watch, we could force him to tell us how to get to the feywild. The easiest way to get close to Mr Witch is during the crowning of the Monarch. Dirlagraun could help us there.

Thaco is standing outside Mr. Light's room. Both Mr's are in the carriage claim not to know how to get to the feywild but Kadayif can tell they are lying.
They have
- [ ] Alchemy Jug
- [x] Hewards spice pouch (Kadayif)
- [ ] Self mending rope
- [ ] Tankard of sobriety
- [ ] A wand of wonder
- [x] Periapt (necklace) of wound closure (Oswald)
- [x] Bag of holding (used) (Pytchley)
- [x] Horseshoe of hold iron (Casimir)
- [x] Loaf of bread of breaking (Alexandra)
- [ ] Set of Mage Armor

Casimir managed to fool Mr Witch into give up his watch. We traded it back to him for information on how to get to the feywild. In front of a mirror in the hall of illusions, we must say
```
Hither, thither, here and there,
Wander yonder, show me where
```  

Thaco made us some impressive balloon animals. I gave my balloon to Oroonoko and gave him a pat on the back.

We went back to the Calliope and picked up a note from Kettlesteam who told us to meet at Silversong lake. Normally Palasha sings here.
Palasha sings a glorious haunting song. The song leads water to shapes rising from the water.
Kettlesteam heckled Palasha in Candlefoot's voice so we grabbed her again. She admitted to stealing Candlefoot's voice so we went to have her give Candlefoot his voice back. Meanwhile Alexandra and Casimir comforted Palasha.

At the hall of illusions, Kettlesteam returned Candlefoot's voice to him by giving him a cornhusk doll. Candlefoot is worried that Palasha won't forgive him.  

We dropped off Kettlesteam with Burley and Mr Witch. Burley kicks out Kettlesteam who says she won't come back tomorrow. Mr. Witch was still upset but I think he's happy.

We then reunited the voiced Candlefoot with Palasha. Candlefoot gave me an acting lesson in gratitude.

A strange severe woman customer, named Alissa, taps Casimir on the shoulder asking him to find her master's lady-love who is hiding out with her sisters in the fey-wild. She is
- the pretty sister
- Common is not her first language
- Has some elven ancestry
- She has crowsfeet around her eyes.
Her master will pay handsomely to know where she is. She gave Casimir a coin of a weird foreign currency. `Coin with an infinity symbol and an arrow pointing down from it on one side, a hand with 6 fingers on the other.`  

We went to the Snail races. Two goblins administer the races. I raced on Flowerflash but came in third. Kadayif won.
<hr>
We are going to the small stalls. We all did terribly at the Almiraj Ring Toss. We mostly outstared the Cyclops. At Catch the Dragon by the Tail, the dragon is named Applesauce. At the gnome poetry contest I nailed the poetry. Oswald bested the goblin who has been needling him in the wrestling match. I guessed the right number of feathers on the Cockatrice Lula.
There is an Aladrin at the prize table. There are circlets of fey-kind which will daily make us more-resemble fey. We took our prizes.

We then went the the lightning dome and prepped for a fight. After three rounds we defeated a scary clown.

Next on the trip is the Bubble-pop Teapot. There are a bunch of goblins drinking tea. Treaclwise is the ride manager. The goblins are talking in non-sense.
```The Baked Bean's skin and blisters came to visit. Now there's no Frog and Toad to the palace, just ball and chalk.
The dustbin lids with no bread and honey get a half-inch from the three tea leaves of the skins and blisters.
```
<hr>
We visited the Pixie Kingdom. Jeremy Plum. I am Dudley Dimple and Oroonoko is Frogface. They shrunk us down to the size of the tiny kingdom. Pinecone is here to ride. Biscuit the hamster is powering the mini ferris wheel. We learned that Burley is a philosopher. Don't fuss with the archfey's rules. Each archfey has a domain with it's own rules.
Zybilna says
no hurting children
no stealing
law of hospitality: don't be rude to guests
law of reciprocity:
law of ownership:
We have been talking to Puddle-mud. Travel is difficult, things take various times to get to places. Feelings effect the environment though the archfey's feelings are far more impactful. Don't let the fey have anything. Thank you acknowledges a debt.
After the pixie kingdom, we went to the coronation of the Witchlight Monarch. Alexandra won the crown.

find the alucorn? Blavorna Blightstraw owns all this land.
We entered the hall of illusions and saw our young selves in the mirrors. Mr. witch opened the portal. Entrance order was Kadayif, Casimir, Alexandra, Pytchley and Oswald. In the tunnels we spotted the mysterious thieves. The frog lady has a big mountain, sow pig has a big forest. We arrived on a quarter mile wide bridge in Hither. The bridge covers a swamp which stinks of peat and decay. Mushrooms cover the lower part of the pillars. There is a lot of fog around here. We are a hundred feet up. We spotted a distant balloon in the sky spinning wildly in the sky.
We safely climbed down the bridge into the swamp below. We hear a strange march with bag-pipes coming towards us. Agdon Longscarf. Six bi-pedal rabbits and a snail. We defeated the harengons, the ran and we kept their giant Snail, Agdon. There are a lot of carrots in the snails bags. We named it Agdon Wetscarf.
We found a raft and dragged it through it the swamp so that Alexandra doesn't get her shoes dirty.

<hr>

We found a shepherds crook but sized for a pixie and a large bag of truffles. As we were walking the mud, we run into a very muddy patch. From it mud-mephits appeared and demanded we answer their riddle. I got it on the first try. They told us Elmer is the man in the tower who made this area muddy. It is still twilight. A gord shaped like a little dragon.
The water level is slowly starting to rise and develops a flow against us. We arrived at an overflowing well. The geyser is 30ft tall. On top of the geyser is floating a bottle labeled "Rain water from the feywild". Bavlorna makes the well do this. We learn Elmer was a hobgoblin.
Can only sing for next three hours. We encountered two beaverfolk arguing in a pair of rowboats. The porcupine and the woodpecker riddle is causing this argument.    

The tower appears before us. It is tilted. Around the base are thick brambles. Hanging from the tower is a hot air balloon. Two serpents are asleep in the brambles. The pilot wigglewog did not survive. Sir Talavar. A shadowy hand pulls the basket into the tower. There are actually two snakes sewed together into one huge snake. A "Snans". These snakes could have been revived from death.
Inside the tower there are a bunch of supplies piled up on the side of the tower which has tilted towards. There are a few barrels of carrots tied to a broken pipe in the floor. There are a lot of broken pipes in the room. There is a chain connected to a shower head.
Upstairs the room is darkened by closed blinds. It is a cozy room with decent furniture. We found a shadow mastiff named "Wover". There are rabbit hunting books. Moosesnakes and me. The cushions are held together.
The third floor is a kitchen/workspace. There are geological logs that may mark wells. The logs detail maintenance going back ten years. He has a decanter of endless water that he was using to maintain the wells. The maps show a tree-stump connected with a tunnel.
The forth floor is covered in webbing. There is a birdcage with a fairydragon straining to get out. The room is dark.

<hr>

Elmer is a man-spider suspended from the ceiling. He bit me twice and I passed out. Eventually Elmer surrendered to us. He thought that if he brought the fairydragon to Bavlorna, she will remove the curse that makes him a ~~man-spider~~.
Bavlorna is in downfall where she holds court. She's doesn't like to leave downfall. Hither, Thither and Yon are locations.
Sir Talavar, was imprisoned in downfall when wigglewog, the bullywog was leading him. Mogwart was helping Sir Talavar at the balloon factory.  
I found abjuration magic reinforcing the cage.  
Sue at The End of the Road, might know more about what's going on or have a way to get Talavar out. The watcher is a serpent with moose antlers that lives up north. Also a hobgoblin village. He is precient.  
He warns us that Bavlorna is much tougher than Elmer. She makes some good deals and some bad deals.  
We are going to the Inn at the end of the road. Where the inkeeper is Tsu.

<hr>

We slept here and played with Wover. I infused Alexandra's armor. Kadayif had some strange dreams.
We are headed north to the Inn in snailside. Oroonoko is tasked with carrying Sir Talavar's cage.
Sir Talavar waited until we were away from Elmer he told us more about the feywild. He says Bavlorna is running things. Zybilna's court is the summer palace. Sir Talavar was caught by a bucket.
Normally a Hag is not powerful enough to run a realm of delight. The only hag powerful enough to to do that is Baba Yaga. We are in Prismir. Perhaps an unstable coven of Hags working together could run a realm of delight.
He taken back to Downfall. The court of Downfall is called the soggy court. Let them speak kindly of wigglewog (the bullywog) and Mogwart. Wigglewog stole his cage. Mogwart was fighting a dozen Bullywogs and probably died.
Titania is the queen of the summer court and one of the most powerful.
There is a feydark like the underdark where the feymorians, giants. The summer palace in a nation in the summer court which is a nations. Feymorians are about three oswalds tall.

We encounteres a small thicket of Mangrove trees. Small caterpillars eat leaves. A small female pixie asks why we are interupting they flock of moths. The adult moths have all run off because Heregons have stolen the pixies crook with a light on it. The Heregon Jepeck stole the crook. These are going to satyr moths which have horns.   
Firebelly toads may eat the moths. Firebelly toads are a creations of Bavlorna. They eat marshmallow plants which are failing because of the fluctuation of water levels. The marshmallow plants are like cat-tails but with marshmallow plants.   

Her name is Lambs-tail. She gives us Moth Silk Gloves. I tinkered with my cookie cutter shaped like a unicorn to have generate light.

We found a field with rising iridescent bubbles. The Mud-Mephits gave us another riddle which Kadayif aced.

A veiled stilt-walker gallops away before we could talk with them. They had a cage of eggs on their back.  

We found the moths eventually. With a three Firebelly toads which attack us. Firebelly toads do not ice. The toads are normal sized and are about the size of a cat.  

We slew the toads and the moths swarmed around my illuminated cookie cutter. They began singing a pan-pipe-like tune similar to a satyr.  

We returned the moths to Lambs-tail. She gives us a silk armor.

We a larger pool which contains the remains of a battle. Nearby is a giant bat sleeping upside down from a branch. It is wearing reigns and a basket to suggest something has been riding it.

There is also a fairy woman. She has a owlish beak and birdlike wings. She is staring at that water. Her name is pellet-wretch. There is something precious to her in the pond, a bog-body of an eladrin. She tells us about what happens to bodies in peat over time. There are two suits of ceramic armor which defend the battle-grounds but may be valuable. She is interested in the scientific properties of the preserved eladrin bodies.

The water is toxic but can be processed into a healing water.

Talavar thinks that disturbing the body is in bad taste in the Summer Court. We agreed to extract the body and and began to fight the ceramic armor.

We used mage hand to tie the rope around the bog body and Kadayif as a elk, towed it out. We placed the body into the basket on Taffy the bat.

To use the water, we need to fill this large jug and bring it to a nearby creature called the Bagiennik. Putting the water in the Bagiennik's nose, will turn it into the healing water. She marks its location on our map.

We defeated the animated armor in battle.

<hr>

We now head to snailside. We hear a scuffle between a human and animal. A hobgoblin youth and is being beaten up by an unknown horror. It wisely flees once we arrive. We sense that it's name is Snappy.

Khenkad the Impetuous. He claims to have been fighting off Snappy. His arm was damaged in the fight. He has a set of four stilts.

He is from snailside and tells us they sell stilts there too. On the horizon we can see a lumpy side of a snail. Snailside is the last stronghold of Zybilna followers in the Summer Court according to Khenkad. Khenkad's mom, Drozedok The Hunter won't help him kill monster.

Snailside is an actual large snail. Its head sticks out 20 to 30ft. There is a small village built on the top of the shell. A dozen or so buildings. One building is larger than the rest. One is Zrorkol The Fair's General Store (in sylvan).

There is a staircase up the side of the shell. Agdan is excited to see the big snail. There are open stables for us to leave Agdan.

Khenkad and the village have been tracking Diana Cloppington to help her. Their stairs are crank operated. There are mostly hobgoblins but also bugbears and fairies. They also are wearing decorative veils similar to the one we saw.

The General store is two-room building. She is an old hobgoblin. She gives me several hobgoblin molars in exchange for the bottle of Witchlight wine. She is interested in finding out where we came from.

The oracle is named Agerg of the Visions. She is selling swamp stilts, mosquito nets, 10ft poles and caltrops. They have a saddle of many shapes. Agdan is too smart to go to Downfall. She tells us that the population is shrinking and that Elmer had failed his hunt so he had to find a new job.

The oracle doesn't see outsiders very often. On the way we pass a large wall of stone with imagery of people from the village including human Diana Cloppington on a screwball horse.

At the oracle's house, someone answered the door. The oracle only uses her powers for members of the town. We are talking to Croza the Shield. We could get an appointment if we get all the monsters removed.

We hear a loud horn in the distant. All the villagers are quite interested in this. We see a pack of hobgoblins on stilts coming back to the village. They seem celebratory and say they have found signs of "her". They are referencing the other part of Diana Cloppington. Khenkad says he will join us and help track the Cloppington Diana.    

We are going to search a mangrove grove. We found the Bandersnatch while tracking Cloppington Diana (Tasha). We eventually found her and calmed her. Khenkad says the oracle will know what to do. We started leading her back to snailside and ran into Drozedok the Hunter. Upon hearing praises of Khenkad's successful slaying of the Bandersnatch, Drozedok embraces her son.

The entire town is pleased to see Cloppington. Veiled stately hobgoblin, Agerg, addresses us. She tells us the Bagiennik is a creature of madness. Its mood fluctuates and may attack. Don't slay the Bagiennik. She wants a sample of hair and blood from the each of us.

She explains that with these samples she will make Poppets out of. The Bagiennik will think the Poppets are you. They are decoys. Baking Bread Poppets are nasty, don't look at them if possible. We consented.

She suggested distracting the Bagiennik by throwing gords filled with coins. We took a long rest.

<hr>

During the rest I made a mind-sharpener and we got some sleep. Agerg completes the Poppets which are bread sized but proportionate to our sizes.

We headed out for the Bagiennik on stilts with the Poppets swaddled in cloth. Kadayif noticed we entered a dry divet, perhaps it's a massive footprint going perpendicular to our path. There is a strange trail of the prints.  

Behind us we hear bagpipes and singing. They are Heregon highwaymen tracking the large footprint things to attacking us.

We came to a glen where we heard whale noises and splashing. Crickets and birds are quiet around. Kadayif turned into a frog to sneak up on it. It is probably the Bagiennik.

We came up with a rather complicated plan to plant the poppets without looking at them. It seemed to work getting the Bagiennik to purify the water.

We returned to snailside without incident and spoke to Agerg. Croza the Shield let us in. Agerg tells us we are in their debt. We collected a number of things from the carnival which were placed in a mortar and pestle. We see a vision of diana at the carnival. The horse is named Tasha. We spotted a vision of Diana and horse.

Agerg is exhausted and needs a break for an hour.

Croza tells us:
- Bavlorna is the animal re-assembler. Heregon are a problem. There is a jabberwock with burning eyes and scales. It flys and kills things. It normally hunts in Thither.

- Toasted Cheese is the name of the goblin who does all the hunting for Bavlorna.   

- There is a a sort of creature like a bear but with big horns and strange curved feet.

- The real brigand leader Agdan hangs around the toll-ways. He can't remove his scarf. The toll-way is a giant tree which would make the snail proportional. It's roots create bridges which allow passage. He works for Bavlorna after having bad blood with Zybilna.

We return to Agerg who also tells us where Talavar's key is. By throwing fairy-dragon bones on a table. Skeleton for a skeleton-key. There's a goblin who is so afraid of being confined that she went to Bavlorna to trade her fear away for an obsession of keys. Bavlorna crafted the traded fear into something new. The goblin has the key in her collection on a giant mobile hill. She points in the direction of the large footprints.

The toll way a big tree stump with enormous intertwined roots.

<hr>

We are asking Drazdak about the hill. They tell us it's called the Tellemey Hill. It eats by absorbing trees. Jingle-jangle, the single-minded goblin lives on the hill. The trees are not treants but they talk for the hill.

## TODO, don't turn you're back on the soggy court
- Appearance obsessed. They are passive-aggressive. They are cruel malicious children which Zybilna kept in check.

We walk and find a well. There is a spout of dirty water. There are trinkets on the top of the spout. There is creature howling and trying to reach the trinkets. It is muscly and dagda-like with also long arms. This is not something natural. Talavar says it's a kangaroo.   
I remembered this was one of the animals not permitted at the carnival. "No demons" was the label. It is a Dretch.   
There is an agreement with the lords of the underworld, but we are honor-bound to kill this.
Its body dissolves away revealing a nice large topaz. I identified is as very magically from the school of divination. It has a memory and an emotion in it. Kadayif touches it which confers a powerful sense of fear.
All of us appear in a new area which is twilight. We are in the woods in winter following a young girl with dark hair. She is clutching her stomach in hunger. She expresses the emotion Kadayif felt. There is small hut now. She girl is going towards it. She collapses in the snow. Kadayif picks her up.

Kadayif revives her and she wanders off towards the hut. Kadayif knocks on the door before the girl can. A very old human woman answers the door. A black cat is sitting by a fire with a pot of stew. She takes in the child and we all appeared again. The hut then stood up and walked away.    

The topaz is finely cut. I got an 8in glass ant figuring (bong) which I traded for a tooth from Oswald.


We continue our journey, and hear the worst noise. A very bad brass instrument. They say it is coming from an enormous mushroom on the next hill. Alexandra approached stealthily poorly.  
A 5ft ambulatory frog introduces itself to Alexandra. They were formerly a member of the court of king Gullup disnuff the XIX (19th).    
He claims to be have been friends of with Gullup and helped dethrone the last king. The frog is delighted to see Talavar.
Count Poddlidop is his name. Gullop will be embarrassed for letting Talavar escape. Talavar says he's from the soggy court.   
He tells us Bavlorna freed them from the tyrant Zybilna. Gullup would not be able to boil the old king under Zybilna.
Talavar tells us all the members of the Soggy Counter are Bullywogs.

Moving on we spotted the enormous human-like tracks and the harengon tracks. After a while we hear singing in sylvan from a group. It's a singing harengon gang fighting with something. A giant winged creature interrupting the singing. It is stitched together from various beasts. We snuck away.

Later we hear pots and pans clanging. A figure is walking towards us. She is wearing a heavy pack with all many of junk.
She has many jars. Most jars have water in them.

Her name is Baba-Gab and the Babel the shoulder mushroom pet.
I greeter her before I noticed her jars a full of tongue. They are growing in the jars. She thanked us for Oswald's gifted ration but wants to feed us a cooked meal.   
While cooking, she sets nine tongues on the table which have utility. Each tongue will confer some language.   
She says Bavlorna doesn't withold gratification. Gab has a deal where Bavlorna wants to learn 8 languages and Draconic.

I ate one of her tongue which had a rocky appearance which conferred a ability to speak Terran.  

She knows of a Tooth-hag in Yon.

<hr>

Post tongue stew. The hag gets a piece of each of our tongues.

I made a key for jingle jangle. Heart shaped handle with square area with a cut-out of a castle with three turrets.

We find the hill where there is a cave shaped like a keyhole. The hill smells nice. As we approach the cave the trees came closer to us and started talking to us. The hill is sad that it can't roam through the mists. Jingle-jangle was startled by the harengon. Telemy Hill is worried the keymaker has reverted to being afraid of being trapped. Telemy thinks she may answer the door. Keys hang in some of the branches.

Telemy wants us to communicate that they don't want jingle jangle to keep digging caves. Jingle Jangle spooks easily.

We enter the cave looking for jingle jangle. In the cave there are three doors we see: a maple and elm and a willow. So we left the cave and talked some trees into giving us keys. Later we ran into a harengon who fled from us into a hole in the ground. We followed it into the hole and then were "ambushed" but we expected that. The harengon appeared to be shapeshifters.

Kadayif thinks are fey things, either meanlocks are made of fear. Redcap made of anger.

<hr>

More fighting with the meanlocks. We eventually defeated them clumsily and rescued jingle jangle. She was collecting truffles when she was attacked by real Heregon which drove her into the meanlock lair where her fear feed them.
jingle jangle was able to find the key to Sir Talavar's a cage who was grateful to be released. He gifts his blade to Alexandra. He also tells us we will need a guide, someone who has made the journey before.

Talavar warns us to watch out for Bavlorna's lornlings. Littler versions of Bavlorna who do her bidding.
jingle jangle gives us a brown weathered key (in the S section for Swamp Hag) to Bavlorna. It opens something on the third floor of Bavlorna's place.

She gives each of us a special key and directions to the Inn. The Inn is mobile and has feet that are different than the hill. They are the same shape as ours but smaller than Tellemey Hill's.

The bartenders name is Tsu.
