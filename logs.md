# Day 1
Four of them were invited to the pumpkin farm house of Madryck. An old man. The house is made out of a house sized pumpkin. The house is cozy. Zybilna is his patron and Madryck knows that these four have lost something at the carnival. He has lost contact with Zybilna. Madryck wants them to find someone named Prismir stuck in the feywild.
Zybilna is an archfey, which is considered a fairy godmother among her followers. Casimir claims to have met her. Alexandra has a book that speaks to Zybilna. Kadayif is strange. Oswald does not know what could be dangerous about the feywild.
Normally Madryck would communicate with Zybilna about the safety of the feywild.
Madryck summoned a carrige for them to take them to the carnival. Fey don't accept gold currency so to speak. The carrige is carved from a pumpkin but not slimy inside.
The carnival's owners are from shadowfell.

Meanwhile, at sunset, I am in a flying carriage as part
Pineham and someone have sent me a letter.
Pineham's letter let me know that my niece lost her tooth. Penelope feels like she is indebted to the tooth-fairy.
The other letter is looking for my help.

Mr. Witch and Mr. Light pull up next to my trailer. Mr. Witch wants my help. He invites me into his and Mr. Light's trailer and asks for my discretion. The two have been having problems with a disgruntled female Kenku guest. She's been using disguises and learned to recognize our security. She has been sabotaging rides and generally ruining guests' experiences. Mr. Light wants Oroonoko and I to blend in and attempt to intercept the kenku guest. He also wants us to not tell anyone about it.  
Thaco came by while Oroonoko and I were preparing to enter the carnival and told me that Palasha and Candlefoot has split up after she proposed. Oroonoko and I waited around the entrance to the park keeping an eye out for groups of four.

Just before the dawn, a Witchlight monarch will be appointed to the person who has contributed the most to the carnival.

There is a new attraction, the lightning dome, where guests can safely fight demons. It is near the entrance.

I caught one of the welcome gifts. Eventually I spotted a group of four travelers and introduced myself by asking if they recognize the Madryck Roslof. They did and I am assisting them. I told them about the Mystery Mine. Zephixo the dwarf runs this.
There is a rail line with carts with seats for 8. We are riding the carts with another couple. The rail line goes into a dragon mouth. Inside their were visions of snakes everywhere! There was also a vision of Alexandra's son dressed as a town guard. Suddenly, I'm in my underwear and everyone is laughing at me, it's terrifying. Then a couple of thugs, ordered by a stately dressed woman to attack us. One more vision appears. The shadow of a woman, dressed as an acrobat. Lights on the ride go out and people scream. Zephixo yells "It's not supposed to do this, I'll try rebooting it". He also recommends Tasha's Fortuneteller.

The booth is a wooden, mechanical dummy. Tasha is a witch-queen who wrote the Demonomicon. Fortune-telling is out of character for her. A halfling couple, in front of us, proposes and the recipient starting rolling on the ground laughing. The proposer ran into the nearby hall of illusions to hide out of embarrassment. Kadayif discovered that perhaps the proposee was magically induced to laugh. Inside the hall of illusions is a series of mirrors which initially reflect our childlike appearances. Later in the maze, our reflections get older. We found the proposer looking at a mirror with a little girl in a pig-mask looking back at him. The proposer is named Rueben. Eventually they meet back up outside the hall and make amends.
With that complete, we all approached the booth to get a fortune but fell under a laughing spell. Still got a fortune though: an embossed card "Skabatha Nightshade and can't remember the first creature she sees when she wakes up"

After we all got our weird fortunes we headed towards the lost property booth to look for the things we have lost. We met Dirlagraun outside the lost property. Dirlagraun loves children and children love playing with her. One child runs away.

We chased the child and spotted the girl in the pig-mask. She says her name is Sow-pig. Her skin is cold and blue-grey. She says "I can't take anything from you, you've got a ticket."

Back at lost-and-found, Dirlagraun apologizes for spooking the child who ran. The child had picked up a ball that belonged to her lost child, Star. We told her that we would help find Star in the feywild.
<hr>

Next stop Calliope. A goblin dressed as a ladybug shakes a cup at us. Ernest the Monkey is playing the instrument. I and Oswald gave him buttons. The Calliope plays music that reflects the mood of the carnival. Ernest is in the body of his trained monkey Bubbles. Bubbles has the body. The body may be balding. Suddenly the Calliope starts playing discordant notes along with the regular notes. The discordant notes stop for a second and a person hiding in the shadows begins to run. I tripped them telekinetically and Oswald grabbed em. The target looks human but patting her down I felt feathers. It's the rebellious kenku who has been causing problems! She says she's on a mission to find her mission patron Zybilna. Her name is Kettlesteam. She wanted to cause a ruckus until the owners show her how to get to the feywild. We released her under the understanding that she would return after the big-top extravaganza.

We were on the way to the feasting grounds when we passed a commotion at the Carousel. Diana Cloppington the centaur, is complaining the Carousel won't stop. She's quite upset that she can't fit onto the ride. Diana told Alexandra that she made a deal with a hag to be reunited with her lost warhorse and that's how she ended up as a centaur. A few of us forced our way to the center of the Carousel and were able to stop the gear mechanism to stop the Carousel. Diana told us that the unicorns on the Carousel were made by a hag and have powers of divination. If we name the unicorns we can talk to them. Four of them are partially named. Alexandra immediately figured out their names and we started riding them. They whispered mysterious things at us. Mine whispered with Oswald "Skabatha Nightshade, granny Nightshade to some. Has the things we seek, you must find her to get your things back. Her lair is a dead hollowed out tree in a sylvan forest. She's part of the hourglass coven with her sisters who she hates but needs." Diana tends to our wounds before we go.

We arrive a the feasting orchard. The trees have fruit. There is a fairycake eating contest going on. Craig from goblin wresting is competing as well. Alexandra won after beating me out by a single cupcake. Overall we ate more than 40 cupcakes.

After recovering from our cupcake feast, we went to the dragonfly rides. Northwind the treent told us that Thaco used to be a knife thrower and Mr. Light and Mr. Witch traded the carnival for something. A dwarf falls from his dragonfly during the ride but Casamir cast feather fall on the dwarf and landed softly on the ground. On the dragonfly, I noticed Kettlesteam by the dragonfly rides. I spotted the moon-masked woman/ghost again.

Next to the Gondola Swans. The swans are giant and pulling 8 person boats. The boat going slowly around the entire park. The swan asks if we are enjoying the "swandolas". Her name is Featherine. She told us about how sad it is that Candlefoot and Palasha broke up. Candlefoot hasn't spoken sense. Kadayif spotted the flog/girl/ghost.

<hr>
Be sure to fix Candlefoot's relationship for mirth points.

The Big Top Extravaganza is about to begin. As we headed over there Casamir ran into an elf wearing a poorly fitting suit. Tintagel is nervous about his first performance on the Big Top Extravaganza. Tintagel invites us into the dressing room. A thin elven man, Mr. Light, is wearing a suit of mirrors. Mr Light is concerned with performers dropping out. Mr Light. Burley is there too.
We signed up to fill in some of the acts by live acting Alexandra's fairy tails.
Oswald and I were in a unicorn costume riding a tandem bicycle.
Burly wants us to meet up after the performance.
The first performer did a very impressive fire-breathing act.
Next up was Candlefoot, a lanky mime. He does sleight of hand tricks and people enjoy it. He does copper-into-gold, coin-into-goldfish and goldfish-into-bigger-fish.
Tintagel goes next. Takes a rabbit out of a hat, and is very nervous. I volunteered to be sawed in half. It went flawlessly and Tintagel forgot to ask for a the potion of revivify he gave me back.
Bugbear lifts several people on a dumb-bell. He then does tug of war with Oswald and I.
Our performance went well.

Afterwards Burly says he'll lead us to Mr. Lights room to pick out payment in. Burly doesn't know where the entrance to the feywild is but thinks his brother is there. Burly says that if we stole Mr Witch's pocket-watch, we could force him to tell us how to get to the feywild. The easiest way to get close to Mr Witch is during the crowning of the Monarch. Dirlagraun could help us there.

Thaco is standing outside Mr. Light's room. Both Mr's are in the carriage claim not to know how to get to the feywild but Kadayif can tell they are lying.
They have
- [ ] Alchemy Jug
- [x] Hewards spice pouch (Kadayif)
- [ ] Self mending rope
- [ ] Tankard of sobriety
- [ ] A wand of wonder
- [x] Periapt (necklace) of wound closure (Oswald)
- [x] Bag of holding (used) (Pytchley)
- [x] Horseshoe of hold iron (Casimir)
- [x] Loaf of bread of breaking (Alexandra)
- [ ] Set of Mage Armor

Casimir managed to fool Mr Witch into give up his watch. We traded it back to him for information on how to get to the feywild. In front of a mirror in the hall of illusions, we must say
```
Hither, thither, here and there,
Wander yonder, show me where
```  

Thaco made us some impressive balloon animals. I gave my balloon to Oroonoko and gave him a pat on the back.

We went back to the Calliope and picked up a note from Kettlesteam who told us to meet at Silversong lake. Normally Palasha sings here.
Palasha sings a glorious haunting song. The song leads water to shapes rising from the water.
Kettlesteam heckled Palasha in Candlefoot's voice so we grabbed her again. She admitted to stealing Candlefoot's voice so we went to have her give Candlefoot his voice back. Meanwhile Alexandra and Casimir comforted Palasha.

At the hall of illusions, Kettlesteam returned Candlefoot's voice to him by giving him a cornhusk doll. Candlefoot is worried that Palasha won't forgive him.  

We dropped off Kettlesteam with Burley and Mr Witch. Burley kicks out Kettlesteam who says she won't come back tomorrow. Mr. Witch was still upset but I think he's happy.

We then reunited the voiced Candlefoot with Palasha. Candlefoot gave me an acting lesson in gratitude.

A strange severe woman customer, named Alissa, taps Casimir on the shoulder asking him to find her master's lady-love who is hiding out with her sisters in the fey-wild. She is
- the pretty sister
- Common is not her first language
- Has some elven ancestry
- She has crowsfeet around her eyes.
Her master will pay handsomely to know where she is. She gave Casimir a coin of a weird foreign currency. `Coin with an infinity symbol and an arrow pointing down from it on one side, a hand with 6 fingers on the other.`  

We went to the Snail races. Two goblins administer the races. I raced on Flowerflash but came in third. Kadayif won.
<hr>
We are going to the small stalls. We all did terribly at the Almiraj Ring Toss. We mostly outstared the Cyclops. At Catch the Dragon by the Tail, the dragon is named Applesauce. At the gnome poetry contest I nailed the poetry. Oswald bested the goblin who has been needling him in the wrestling match. I guessed the right number of feathers on the Cockatrice Lula.
There is an Aladrin at the prize table. There are circlets of fey-kind which will daily make us more-resemble fey. We took our prizes.

We then went the the lightning dome and prepped for a fight. After three rounds we defeated a scary clown.

Next on the trip is the Bubble-pop Teapot. There are a bunch of goblins drinking tea. Treaclwise is the ride manager. The goblins are talking in non-sense.
```The Baked Bean's skin and blisters came to visit. Now there's no Frog and Toad to the palace, just ball and chalk.
The dustbin lids with no bread and honey get a half-inch from the three tea leaves of the skins and blisters.
```
<hr>
We visited the Pixie Kingdom. Jeremy Plum. I am Dudley Dimple and Oroonoko is Frogface. They shrunk us down to the size of the tiny kingdom. Pinecone is here to ride. Biscuit the hamster is powering the mini ferris wheel. We learned that Burley is a philosopher. Don't fuss with the archfey's rules. Each archfey has a domain with it's own rules.
Zybilna says
no hurting children
no stealing
law of hospitality: don't be rude to guests
law of reciprocity:
law of ownership:
We have been talking to Puddle-mud. Travel is difficult, things take various times to get to places. Feelings effect the environment though the archfey's feelings are far more impactful. Don't let the fey have anything. Thank you acknowledges a debt.
After the pixie kingdom, we went to the coronation of the Witchlight Monarch. Alexandra won the crown.

find the alucorn? Blavorna Blightstraw owns all this land.
We entered the hall of illusions and saw our young selves in the mirrors. Mr. witch opened the portal. Entrance order was Kadayif, Casimir, Alexandra, Pytchley and Oswald. In the tunnels we spotted the mysterious thieves. The frog lady has a big mountain, sow pig has a big forest. We arrived on a quarter mile wide bridge in Hither. The bridge covers a swamp which stinks of peat and decay. Mushrooms cover the lower part of the pillars. There is a lot of fog around here. We are a hundred feet up. We spotted a distant balloon in the sky spinning wildly in the sky.
We safely climbed down the bridge into the swamp below. We hear a strange march with bag-pipes coming towards us. Agdon Longscarf. Six bi-pedal rabbits and a snail. We defeated the harengons, the ran and we kept their giant Snail, Agdon. There are a lot of carrots in the snails bags. We named it Agdon Wetscarf.
We found a raft and dragged it through it the swamp so that Alexandra doesn't get her shoes dirty.

<hr>

We found a shepherds crook but sized for a pixie and a large bag of truffles. As we were walking the mud, we run into a very muddy patch. From it mud-mephits appeared and demanded we answer their riddle. I got it on the first try. They told us Elmer is the man in the tower who made this area muddy. It is still twilight. A gord shaped like a little dragon.
The water level is slowly starting to rise and develops a flow against us. We arrived at an overflowing well. The geyser is 30ft tall. On top of the geyser is floating a bottle labeled "Rain water from the feywild". Bavlorna makes the well do this. We learn Elmer was a hobgoblin.
Can only sing for next three hours. We encountered two beaverfolk arguing in a pair of rowboats. The porcupine and the woodpecker riddle is causing this argument.    

The tower appears before us. It is tilted. Around the base are thick brambles. Hanging from the tower is a hot air balloon. Two serpents are asleep in the brambles. The pilot wigglewog did not survive. Sir Talavar. A shadowy hand pulls the basket into the tower. There are actually two snakes sewed together into one huge snake. A "Snans". These snakes could have been revived from death.
Inside the tower there are a bunch of supplies piled up on the side of the tower which has tilted towards. There are a few barrels of carrots tied to a broken pipe in the floor. There are a lot of broken pipes in the room. There is a chain connected to a shower head.
Upstairs the room is darkened by closed blinds. It is a cozy room with decent furniture. We found a shadow mastiff named "Wover". There are rabbit hunting books. Moosesnakes and me. The cushions are held together.
The third floor is a kitchen/workspace. There are geological logs that may mark wells. The logs detail maintenance going back ten years. He has a decanter of endless water that he was using to maintain the wells. The maps show a tree-stump connected with a tunnel.
The forth floor is covered in webbing. There is a birdcage with a fairydragon straining to get out. The room is dark.

<hr>

Elmer is a man-spider suspended from the ceiling. He bit me twice and I passed out. Eventually Elmer surrendered to us. He thought that if he brought the fairydragon to Bavlorna, she will remove the curse that makes him a ~~man-spider~~.
Bavlorna is in downfall where she holds court. She's doesn't like to leave downfall. Hither, Thither and Yon are locations.
Sir Talavar, was imprisoned in downfall when wigglewog, the bullywog was leading him. Morgort was helping Sir Talavar at the balloon factory.  
I found abjuration magic reinforcing the cage.  
Sue at The End of the Road, might know more about what's going on or have a way to get Talavar out. The watcher is a serpent with moose antlers that lives up north. Also a hobgoblin village. He is precient.  
He warns us that Bavlorna is much tougher than Elmer. She makes some good deals and some bad deals.  
We are going to the Inn at the end of the road. Where the inkeeper is Tsu.

<hr>

We slept here and played with Wover. I infused Alexandra's armor. Kadayif had some strange dreams.
We are headed north to the Inn in snailside. Oroonoko is tasked with carrying Sir Talavar's cage.
Sir Talavar waited until we were away from Elmer he told us more about the feywild. He says Bavlorna is running things. Zybilna's court is the summer palace. Sir Talavar was caught by a bucket.
Normally a Hag is not powerful enough to run a realm of delight. The only hag powerful enough to to do that is Baba Yaga. We are in Prismir. Perhaps an unstable coven of Hags working together could run a realm of delight.
He taken back to Downfall. The court of Downfall is called the soggy court. Let them speak kindly of wigglewog (the bullywog) and Morgort. Wigglewog stole his cage. Morgort was fighting a dozen Bullywogs and probably died.
Titania is the queen of the summer court and one of the most powerful.
There is a feydark like the underdark where the feymorians, giants. The summer palace in a nation in the summer court which is a nations. Feymorians are about three oswalds tall.

We encounteres a small thicket of Mangrove trees. Small caterpillars eat leaves. A small female pixie asks why we are interupting they flock of moths. The adult moths have all run off because Heregons have stolen the pixies crook with a light on it. The Heregon Jepeck stole the crook. These are going to satyr moths which have horns.   
Firebelly toads may eat the moths. Firebelly toads are a creations of Bavlorna. They eat marshmallow plants which are failing because of the fluctuation of water levels. The marshmallow plants are like cat-tails but with marshmallow plants.   

Her name is Lambs-tail. She gives us Moth Silk Gloves. I tinkered with my cookie cutter shaped like a unicorn to have generate light.

We found a field with rising iridescent bubbles. The Mud-Mephits gave us another riddle which Kadayif aced.

A veiled stilt-walker gallops away before we could talk with them. They had a cage of eggs on their back.  

We found the moths eventually. With a three Firebelly toads which attack us. Firebelly toads do not ice. The toads are normal sized and are about the size of a cat.  

We slew the toads and the moths swarmed around my illuminated cookie cutter. They began singing a pan-pipe-like tune similar to a satyr.  

We returned the moths to Lambs-tail. She gives us a silk armor.

We a larger pool which contains the remains of a battle. Nearby is a giant bat sleeping upside down from a branch. It is wearing reigns and a basket to suggest something has been riding it.

There is also a fairy woman. She has a owlish beak and birdlike wings. She is staring at that water. Her name is pellet-wretch. There is something precious to her in the pond, a bog-body of an eladrin. She tells us about what happens to bodies in peat over time. There are two suits of ceramic armor which defend the battle-grounds but may be valuable. She is interested in the scientific properties of the preserved eladrin bodies.

The water is toxic but can be processed into a healing water.

Talavar thinks that disturbing the body is in bad taste in the Summer Court. We agreed to extract the body and and began to fight the ceramic armor.

We used mage hand to tie the rope around the bog body and Kadayif as a elk, towed it out. We placed the body into the basket on Taffy the bat.

To use the water, we need to fill this large jug and bring it to a nearby creature called the Bagiennik. Putting the water in the Bagiennik's nose, will turn it into the healing water. She marks its location on our map.

We defeated the animated armor in battle.

<hr>

We now head to snailside. We hear a scuffle between a human and animal. A hobgoblin youth and is being beaten up by an unknown horror. It wisely flees once we arrive. We sense that it's name is Snappy.

Khenkad the Impetuous. He claims to have been fighting off Snappy. His arm was damaged in the fight. He has a set of four stilts.

He is from snailside and tells us they sell stilts there too. On the horizon we can see a lumpy side of a snail. Snailside is the last stronghold of Zybilna followers in the Summer Court according to Khenkad. Khenkad's mom, Drozedok The Hunter won't help him kill monster.

Snailside is an actual large snail. Its head sticks out 20 to 30ft. There is a small village built on the top of the shell. A dozen or so buildings. One building is larger than the rest. One is Zrorkol The Fair's General Store (in sylvan).

There is a staircase up the side of the shell. Agdan is excited to see the big snail. There are open stables for us to leave Agdan.

Khenkad and the village have been tracking Diana Cloppington to help her. Their stairs are crank operated. There are mostly hobgoblins but also bugbears and fairies. They also are wearing decorative veils similar to the one we saw.

The General store is two-room building. She is an old hobgoblin. She gives me several hobgoblin molars in exchange for the bottle of Witchlight wine. She is interested in finding out where we came from.

The oracle is named Agerg of the Visions. She is selling swamp stilts, mosquito nets, 10ft poles and caltrops. They have a saddle of many shapes. Agdan is too smart to go to Downfall. She tells us that the population is shrinking and that Elmer had failed his hunt so he had to find a new job.

The oracle doesn't see outsiders very often. On the way we pass a large wall of stone with imagery of people from the village including human Diana Cloppington on a screwball horse.

At the oracle's house, someone answered the door. The oracle only uses her powers for members of the town. We are talking to Croza the Shield. We could get an appointment if we get all the monsters removed.

We hear a loud horn in the distant. All the villagers are quite interested in this. We see a pack of hobgoblins on stilts coming back to the village. They seem celebratory and say they have found signs of "her". They are referencing the other part of Diana Cloppington. Khenkad says he will join us and help track the Cloppington Diana.    

We are going to search a mangrove grove. We found the Bandersnatch while tracking Cloppington Diana (Tasha). We eventually found her and calmed her. Khenkad says the oracle will know what to do. We started leading her back to snailside and ran into Drozedok the Hunter. Upon hearing praises of Khenkad's successful slaying of the Bandersnatch, Drozedok embraces her son.

The entire town is pleased to see Cloppington. Veiled stately hobgoblin, Agerg, addresses us. She tells us the Bagiennik is a creature of madness. Its mood fluctuates and may attack. Don't slay the Bagiennik. She wants a sample of hair and blood from the each of us.

She explains that with these samples she will make Poppets out of. The Bagiennik will think the Poppets are you. They are decoys. Baking Bread Poppets are nasty, don't look at them if possible. We consented.

She suggested distracting the Bagiennik by throwing gords filled with coins. We took a long rest.

<hr>

During the rest I made a mind-sharpener and we got some sleep. Agerg completes the Poppets which are bread sized but proportionate to our sizes.

We headed out for the Bagiennik on stilts with the Poppets swaddled in cloth. Kadayif noticed we entered a dry divet, perhaps it's a massive footprint going perpendicular to our path. There is a strange trail of the prints.  

Behind us we hear bagpipes and singing. They are Heregon highwaymen tracking the large footprint things to attacking us.

We came to a glen where we heard whale noises and splashing. Crickets and birds are quiet around. Kadayif turned into a frog to sneak up on it. It is probably the Bagiennik.

We came up with a rather complicated plan to plant the poppets without looking at them. It seemed to work getting the Bagiennik to purify the water.

We returned to snailside without incident and spoke to Agerg. Croza the Shield let us in. Agerg tells us we are in their debt. We collected a number of things from the carnival which were placed in a mortar and pestle. We see a vision of diana at the carnival. The horse is named Tasha. We spotted a vision of Diana and horse.

Agerg is exhausted and needs a break for an hour.

Croza tells us:
- Bavlorna is the animal re-assembler. Heregon are a problem. There is a jabberwock with burning eyes and scales. It flys and kills things. It normally hunts in Thither.

- Toasted Cheese is the name of the goblin who does all the hunting for Bavlorna.   

- There is a a sort of creature like a bear but with big horns and strange curved feet.

- The real brigand leader Agdan hangs around the toll-ways. He can't remove his scarf. The toll-way is a giant tree which would make the snail proportional. It's roots create bridges which allow passage. He works for Bavlorna after having bad blood with Zybilna.

We return to Agerg who also tells us where Talavar's key is. By throwing fairy-dragon bones on a table. Skeleton for a skeleton-key. There's a goblin who is so afraid of being confined that she went to Bavlorna to trade her fear away for an obsession of keys. Bavlorna crafted the traded fear into something new. The goblin has the key in her collection on a giant mobile hill. She points in the direction of the large footprints.

The toll way a big tree stump with enormous intertwined roots.

<hr>

We are asking Drazdak about the hill. They tell us it's called the Tellemey Hill. It eats by absorbing trees. Jingle-jangle, the single-minded goblin lives on the hill. The trees are not treants but they talk for the hill.

## TODO, don't turn you're back on the soggy court
- Appearance obsessed. They are passive-aggressive. They are cruel malicious children which Zybilna kept in check.

We walk and find a well. There is a spout of dirty water. There are trinkets on the top of the spout. There is creature howling and trying to reach the trinkets. It is muscly and dagda-like with also long arms. This is not something natural. Talavar says it's a kangaroo.   
I remembered this was one of the animals not permitted at the carnival. "No demons" was the label. It is a Dretch.   
There is an agreement with the lords of the underworld, but we are honor-bound to kill this.
Its body dissolves away revealing a nice large topaz. I identified is as very magically from the school of divination. It has a memory and an emotion in it. Kadayif touches it which confers a powerful sense of fear.
All of us appear in a new area which is twilight. We are in the woods in winter following a young girl with dark hair. She is clutching her stomach in hunger. She expresses the emotion Kadayif felt. There is small hut now. She girl is going towards it. She collapses in the snow. Kadayif picks her up.

Kadayif revives her and she wanders off towards the hut. Kadayif knocks on the door before the girl can. A very old human woman answers the door. A black cat is sitting by a fire with a pot of stew. She takes in the child and we all appeared again. The hut then stood up and walked away.    

The topaz is finely cut. I got an 8in glass ant figuring (bong) which I traded for a tooth from Oswald.


We continue our journey, and hear the worst noise. A very bad brass instrument. They say it is coming from an enormous mushroom on the next hill. Alexandra approached stealthily poorly.  
A 5ft ambulatory frog introduces itself to Alexandra. They were formerly a member of the court of king Gullup disnuff the XIX (19th).    
He claims to be have been friends of with Gullup and helped dethrone the last king. The frog is delighted to see Talavar.
Count Poddlidop is his name. Gullop will be embarrassed for letting Talavar escape. Talavar says he's from the soggy court.   
He tells us Bavlorna freed them from the tyrant Zybilna. Gullup would not be able to boil the old king under Zybilna.
Talavar tells us all the members of the Soggy Counter are Bullywogs.

Moving on we spotted the enormous human-like tracks and the harengon tracks. After a while we hear singing in sylvan from a group. It's a singing harengon gang fighting with something. A giant winged creature interrupting the singing. It is stitched together from various beasts. We snuck away.

Later we hear pots and pans clanging. A figure is walking towards us. She is wearing a heavy pack with all many of junk.
She has many jars. Most jars have water in them.

Her name is Baba-Gab and the Babel the shoulder mushroom pet.
I greeter her before I noticed her jars a full of tongue. They are growing in the jars. She thanked us for Oswald's gifted ration but wants to feed us a cooked meal.   
While cooking, she sets nine tongues on the table which have utility. Each tongue will confer some language.   
She says Bavlorna doesn't withold gratification. Gab has a deal where Bavlorna wants to learn 8 languages and Draconic.

I ate one of her tongue which had a rocky appearance which conferred a ability to speak Terran.  

She knows of a Tooth-hag in Yon.

<hr>

Post tongue stew. The hag gets a piece of each of our tongues.

I made a key for jingle jangle. Heart shaped handle with square area with a cut-out of a castle with three turrets.

We find the hill where there is a cave shaped like a keyhole. The hill smells nice. As we approach the cave the trees came closer to us and started talking to us. The hill is sad that it can't roam through the mists. Jingle-jangle was startled by the harengon. Telemy Hill is worried the keymaker has reverted to being afraid of being trapped. Telemy thinks she may answer the door. Keys hang in some of the branches.

Telemy wants us to communicate that they don't want jingle jangle to keep digging caves. Jingle Jangle spooks easily.

We enter the cave looking for jingle jangle. In the cave there are three doors we see: a maple and elm and a willow. So we left the cave and talked some trees into giving us keys. Later we ran into a harengon who fled from us into a hole in the ground. We followed it into the hole and then were "ambushed" but we expected that. The harengon appeared to be shapeshifters.

Kadayif thinks are fey things, either meanlocks are made of fear. Redcap made of anger.

<hr>

More fighting with the meanlocks. We eventually defeated them clumsily and rescued jingle jangle. She was collecting truffles when she was attacked by real Heregon which drove her into the meanlock lair where her fear feed them.
jingle jangle was able to find the key to Sir Talavar's a cage who was grateful to be released. He gifts his blade to Alexandra. He also tells us we will need a guide, someone who has made the journey before.

Talavar warns us to watch out for Bavlorna's lornlings. Littler versions of Bavlorna who do her bidding.
jingle jangle gives us a brown weathered key (in the S section for Swamp Hag) to Bavlorna. It opens something on the third floor of Bavlorna's place.

jingle jangle gives us also slices of key-lime pie. She tells us the Harengon are fast on the trees. She offers us a set of thieves tools who used to belong to a plumber as well as a few other keys.

She gives a bus tickets

JJ also tells us that attempting to hurt kids just sends the kids to a sort of purgatory.


<hr>

She gives each of us a special key and directions to the Inn. The Inn is mobile and has feet that are different than the hill. They are the same shape as ours but smaller than Tellemey Hill's.

Water levels are up again but we find the Inn okay. It is walking towards us and stops. It's a stone house shaped building with dozens of feet carrying it around.

The Inn is pretty busy. Leprechauns make shoes. There is a depressed Leprechaun (Clurichaun) in the basement drinking. The Clurichaun's name is Molly O'floog. We bounced her out at Tsu's request.

The bartenders name is Tsu.

Istaria, a pregnant spring Eladrin, is on her way to the Watcher.

There are satyrs playing a dice game that I joined in on.
I lost my ability to clap but got a recipe for imitation human meat. Win-win

Derek is the chef. Cutest goblin ever.

<hr>

While gambling, a humanoid plant person appears. She doesn't like the noise. She says the potted tree is hers. We call her "Buddy". She doesn't like that her tree is in the noisy bar.

We asked Tsu about her bark arms. She said it's a result of continuous existence in the feywild. We are asking about getting a guide through the mist.

She knows someone who stumbled through the mist without a head. Might have been a scarecrow. Sometimes Bavlorna hears things. The scarecrow is in Downfall now.

We are thinking of going to the Watcher to find a guide through the mist. We are also staying close to the bachelorette's party.

The party is creepy and looking for "food". Alexandra brought them free dumplings which they hated. They indicated that they wanted to eat a person so Alexandra Suggested that they call it a night which failed to take.

Kadayif attempted to play a very bad song, but the drunk party ended up attacking us. After a raucous fight Kadayif convinced the the Maenad to take a bath and sleep the rest of the night.   

Afterwards we talked to the trio of fairies who are drinking beer out of acorns. They are gossiping. Hazey, Hops, Lemon drop, Miss noggin introduced themselves to me. They are mushroom hunters who have a Morel compass.

One of the fairies says that there is an entrance to Bavlorna's place through a mirror from a carnival. Bavlorna is a shut-in who doesn't trust anyone other than herself. She hates her sisters. The fairies say that King Gallop XIX of the Soggy Court may be on his way out. Taking the head off of the figure head. The Soggy Court doesn't plan for the future. They are short-sighted. SC respect titles and fancy-pants stuff. Ms. Noggin comments Bavlorna is too lazy to wipe out the SG which she would like to do. The balloon factory was damaged in Sir Talavar's escape. The mists are preventing the other courts from taking over Hither here.

While talking to the fairies, a frog creature entered the bar which Kadayif remembered. Tsu is very concerned for us and tells us to do nothing and say nothing. The Creature talks to the satyrs who are mildly put out. It talks to the elven couple and we eavesdropped. It is talking about a deal the words "Palace", "downfall" and a child.  

<hr>

We take a good nice rest with a hot bath and meet in the kitchen for breakfast.

A human and a dwarf adventurers are there. They are armed and armored. We approached them. They are part of the Valor's Call. Molliver is the human and Elkhorn is the dwarf. They are seeking Bavlorna. The party split to save time on the queen's highway. Most of their time has been spent trying to get out of hither. They are going to find their way through the mists now.
They came from Greyhawk a place I have heard of. I got a Tasha's statue from there. Their patron is Mordecai the magician.
The mists are Dreadmists. There are Dread Domains which are ruled by dreadlords. They all have mists that make it hard to pass. The way to get through the mists with a mist talisman. An object which has a connection to the plane you are trying to get to. We need one talisman for the group.

We also talked to the elves that were in the corner yesterday. They are Elim the woman and male Torkal. They made a deal with the lornling. They came to see Zybilna, a patron of children. Their daughter, Ashley, is missing. They think Bavlorna will be able to reunite them with their daughter. They are from Amn.

Elkhorn and Molliver are complaining about Elkhorn losing his compass which points to the Palace of the Hearts Desire. Elkhorn couldn't see the Harengon who took it.

We may get three questions total or three for the group for the Watcher.


We depart from the Inn and head towards the Watcher. We heard a children-like screaming from downriver.

We spot a humanoid frog by the river fishing. His name is Oofgonk. The soggy court is in downfall. He is a simple peasant. Lactoads. He says the screaming is from a devilkin wearing a hat. The devilkin has stones around that make noises. Devilkin are fey of panic who like discordance but not harmonies.

We come to the source of the noise. A cave on an island in middle of a lake with 8 stones as path. The cave is covered by a terrible tent. Each stone gets higher pitched.

We drove the devilkin away by singing in harmony and stepping on the stones in harmony.

The hut is a single room. A rusted old harp sits on one of the straw beds.

In the cave under the hut, a serpent with a moose head pokes it's head up. It seems sad. It speaks in rhymes.

Astoria's husband is trapped on the other side of the mist.

How to free Zybilna:
"A unicorn's horn and the queens true name or smashing of Iggwilv's cauldron"

To defeat Bavlorna, it will be easy to cause a infighting with the hags.

<hr>

We are prepped for the Toll Stroll. The swamps on the way are awful. The stilts are doing a lot of work. We headed to some high ground that looked dry but there was lady on the hill weeping. She says her love left her. She is not conventionally attractive. She is Sybella and she now thinks that Oswald is her love.   
She gave her looks away freely in exchange for true love that she feels all the time.
She was robbed on the tollway. We tricked her by telling her Oswald's brother was nearby and needed love.

After departing, on our journey the water receded to the point where there is a clear stream adjacent to the mud. The stream cleans Oswald's feet. Looking into the stream, we saw visions. It's a frog lady dressed in knight's garb sitting stoically in a prison cell. There is a nicely dressed bullywog looking in on the one in the cell.

I see a heart in a box beating. The box is cold. Panning out The room is a meat locker and the heart is the coldest. A creature enters the locker. A short fey woman with a red hat and boots, looks around at the meat supply. She walks out to a balcony where there are creatures including vansle, the satyr who was trying to do strip poker.
She is a red-cap which is a fey-creature formed out of murderous rage.


Kadayif saw another lady walking out of a small chamber with a storm behind her. Her shadow is not attached and moving at a different pace.

Alexandra spots a Bullywog with a big fancy collar. Long curled coattails. He is in a decripted shanty. He looks scared holding a large black tome. She follows the vision which advances. The Bullywog is going down stairs, and notices hornets swarming in from the top.     

The visions are floating away down the river. After the visions fade, we were joined by a indigo-cloaked figure. We are also at brigands tollway. There are wooden bridges and root bridges.

The indigo-cloaked figure lowers his hood to reveal a Harengon. He stole Oswald's signet ring, Alexandra's butterfly glasses, one of my wizard puppets of minor illusion.

He refers the the wizard puppet as Ringulrun. The wizard from the Valors Call group. Agdan says Ringulrun and a paladin ran into him while he was tied to the tree.


A raft and a boat appear.
Raft
- 1 crossbow
- 1 bagpiper
- 1 brigands

Boat
- 1 crossbow
- 1 bagpiper
- 3 brigands

He says his mom is going to be so mad. He says Bavlorna made him do that. He says his cache in the tree. We cut off part of his scarf and sewed bells into the rest of it. We took their boat to his fort.

<hr>

We rested here at Agdon's. The harengons give us a boat and point the way to Downfall.
Downfall is misty. There is thick fog that limits our sight to 20ft.

Someone's been balloons (Sir Talavar). We are watching out for Morgort.

There are 2 bullywogs in a boat, wearing fancy soiled garb. They tell us we must see the king. All travelers must go see the king.

There are clothesline with soiled, ill-fitted clothes hanging from them.

There is hot-air balloon, staked to the ground. Swamp gas is filling it up, only to have it deflate when the gas escapes out holes. Two bullywogs are seweing it up. Sir Talavar slashed this balloon to prevent chase. They also tell us to go see the king.

We started walked across stepping stones. One of them raised up and spoke to us. It didn't like being stepped on.

We spotted a hut in the middle of the lake.

We approached a wooden structure on stilts above the lake. Smoke billows from the conical roof. A bullywog invites us inside to help. The roof is starting to catch fire. There are many little fires inside. There are three wooden buckets. Two are filled with water. We helped fight the fire started by animated hot-coals. This is the balloon factory. We put of the fires.
The workshop is in a bad shape. He gives us a broach that will identify us as friends of the court. Morgort has a pilot's license. Only Morgort and Wigglewog have licenses.

We came to the bridge of talking heads. There are many bullywog heads mounted on spears. There was a child size figure on the bridge, with lobster claws. He mumbled to himself, and then all the heads started talking. Some of the heads can't hear the figure.
The heads are former kings and queens. The figure is named Clapperclaws. Clapperclaws had a gord for a head, because the brigands stole his real head, the stags head we recovered from Agdon's lair. We traded it back for his gord head.

Granny Skabatha Nightshade created Clapperclaws who has travelled through the mist. She wanted Clapperclaws to work in her garden screaming.

We went on to an island to meet King Gullop. A grand marble Gazebo, some pillars are sinking into the mud, and the gazebo is askew. Someone is playing the harp. They are going to root out traitors. He orders us wine and then dismisses the courtiers.

`If it Pleases you, I Prince Pytchley of the Pipe Organs present our party people: Pious Oswald, Puzzle-solving Alexandra and Polymorphing Kadayif.`

I was asked to find Illig of Muckstump immediately, the revolution lives. The balloon factory was set ablaze by arsonists. The are in the prison past the proving grounds. They have trials by combat at the proving ground. They need a strong warrior.

The note says
`Find Illig, the Baron of Muckstump, at once. The revolution lives!`

Gullop orders us to go to the Royal Tailor. He has a small baby crocodile called Snoodles. Gullop suspects the tailor stole Gullop's large black book. His advisor, Lady Squelchtoe is possibly involved.

Gullop had taken Bavlorna's Big book of bad blood, a list of everyone who Bavlorna doesn't like. Gullop sent someone to take it. He then lost it and wants it back. He last had it at the tailor.

<hr>

He starts shoeing us off until the party to celebrate us.

We crossed a path near to the Sinking palace and the Prison cells. The tailor is Baron Slimetongue of Festerblight in the Sinking Palace. The tailor shop has a wall of neckties and all the clothes smell like the building.

I'm getting a wide denim necktie with a pocket, a bolo tie, and denim ascot. Also silk shorteralls and denim epaulettes.

Kadayif didn't find the book with Slimetongue. Slimetongue remembered the king visiting with a tome when Lady Squelchtoe called him away urgently to see Glompglorp, The Great and Powerful Salamancer. Slimetongue seems earnest.

We are planning on visiting to investigate Lady Squelchtoe. The guest book lists written in Gullop, Baron Grugenos, and The Duchess of the Algae Bloom. We are told that Earl Grumple of Stinkwater is baking a cake for the party. Slimetongue directs us southward to the housing district where Grugenos lives.

There is a knotty tree with a clothesline with very old homemade clothes dangling from them. One end of the clothesline disappears into the fog. From in the tree from Sprites start yelling rude things at us.

We made scary illusions for them but that triggered the tree to attack. Big Barkless is a tree. The tree is enormous. It strikes Oswald heavily and we decided to flee.

As we get out of sight of the tree, it feels cold, despair and ennui. A haunting flute is heard over a field of toadstools. We passed by to go to the Bullywog huts instead of investigating.

We arrived at Grugenos' hut which he claims is humble. He has recently been named Baron. It is the Bullywog from Alexandra's vision. For the barony he procured something valuable for Gullop. He's nervous with the line of questioning. Oswald persuaded him to share is tale. He stole of a book from the lady in the middle of the lake (Bavlorna). Gullop wants to know if he is in the book, before he returns it. He says will feel better when the book is returned.

He just walked right in supposedly. The house is on stilts. Inside is a bath. There are hornets and lornlings as protection. Kadayif heals his hornet bites. He was just lucky that she was not in the pool. There is a hidden passageway on the second floor behind the mirror. He doesn't know where the passageway leads.

Bavlorna has a cook, and is friends with a merchant that came by. The merchant comes from Yon in a balloon made from clouds. Bavlorna has a lily-pad that is her chariot. The house is three stories tall.

He tells us where Illig lives and we go there. The hut is locked and inside is a Bullywog clutching a spear. There are 4 more Bullywog here too. He claims Gullop is witless buffoon. They are upset that he canceled by Pizza-Thursdays, he let Talavar escape, among other things. Illig would the crown himself.

He says he has great plans pointing to scrawled image on the floor of the king with a dagger in his eye. His plan is not very well thought out.

There is a box is the back of the room with Bavlorna's name on it. Illig says the box has dead animals in it. He plans to deliver the dead animals to Bavlorna to appease her. Illig says Bavlorna doesn't like Gullop because he allowed Talavar escaped through the soggy court. Illig offers us mummified toad that when put into hot water, casts darkness for 10 minutes.

<hr>

We first asked them to look for the book for us but then we renegged and said we wouldn't get in their way.

We then went to find Lady Squelchtoe. She has an office in the sinking palace and is an advisor to Gullop. Frog faces are on the art on the wood panelled walls. The wood is warped. She is looking at a desk with papers.

We asked about why she called the king away from the tailors. She said Glompglorp the Salamancer requested the king. Salamancer can have visions.  

Glompglorp the Salamancer is unreliable and has visions which sometimes predict the future. Glompglorp's dad was a construction worker who helped build the sinking palace.

She tells us Bavlorna was mad that they lost Talavar.     

There is one panel that stands out. Kadayif went outside to turn into a mouse to investigate the panel. I distracted Glompglorp while Kadayif found peep holes at the end of the hidden hallway and saw the tailor's place.

We snuck into Salamancer's office. He has a crystal ball and a cloak. There is a portrait on the wall

I found in the desk drawer is a flyer for a trinket emporium. It has a rotating selection of goods.
```
Charm, Trinket, and Bauble's Emporium of Goods
All the way from Yon!
Rotating Stock, when we're out we're out!

Very good thimble (fingertip not included)
Bundle of dry wood (great for starting fires)
Moonlight Monocle (no more fumbling in the dark)
Ink portraits (if we have to look at you, so should you)
```

We then attended the party having found nothing else of interest.

Everyone is here. Duke Iggwilv is here and happy to see us.


Gullop enlists Oswald into fighting Morgort in trial by combat.

Salamancer is performing mundane party tricks. We see the princess, with her attendant, enthralled by the Salamancer. Salamancer disappeared with a smoke bomb against a wall.

There is a blue elf in the corner who just finished playing a flute. Oswald and Alexandra talked to the princess. Octavian Melanine. Wishy washy. Came here for a deal.

He had been having trouble with a girlfriend. Sometimes she would think she didn't love me. He couldn't bear being broken up with. He traded his heartbreak away with his heart for away for a goats heart. Now he doesn't feel heartbreak. He doesn't notice much, but emotions.

He points out that Queen Mucklemoss is still cross, despite being engaged to the king. The merchants are here, they have parked their balloon behind the jail.

Squelchtoe's servant lost something. Name is Revooles. Is here serving dishes.

Salamancer says the merchants do have a spell book. He is afraid that the princess wants to have her killed. He says the merchants need a book to give up their spell book that he needs. He says he knows of Bavlorna's book and that Baron Grugenos stole it.

Gullop wanted to know that he wasn't in the book. Lady Squelchtoe told him to steal the book. Squelchtoe wants Gullop to be killed by Bavlorna. She sent a servant through the secret passage where Salamancer stole it. Then someone took it from Salamancer. It's not in the swamp.

Salamancer last had the book in his office. He left it there while he was leaving to get gunpowder to the "teleportation" trick. The gunpowder was in the stables.

Perhaps someone purchased the Moonlight Monocle from the merchants.

Oswald is approached by a waiter who tells him, lady Squelchtoe wants to speak to him.

<hr>

Lady Squelchtoe presents a plan to destroy the Soggy Court. She wants to get the fighting tree, "Big Barkless", to follow someone who has taunted it to laying a path of destruction.

Squelchtoe has a disgust for the way things exist as they are now.

We went to go chat with Duke Ickrind.

Hags are solitary but not social but they always have a coven.

The cake is wheeled out. It is a beautiful cinnamon and swampwater and Gullop cuts it with a dagger. Inside the cake is a whole bullywog. The assassin was baked inside.

Revooles was anxious about Squelchtoe firing him.

We observed the Salamancer performing again. He is performing a vision on someone. He failed to hypnotize me with his touch but Alexandra leaned into seeing something. She did see visions of her husband. She also spoke to Zybilna who told her she was hallucinating.

Zybilna is frozen in time. She had a material plane accent.

1. Always check where you least expect it
2. Always ask for the thing you want
3. Don't pick a fight you can't win

The baker ran off and escaped.

We spoke to Gullop again to ask if he has recovered the book. But he has not found it again. He prepared a suite for us to stay in.

We talked to Quobleslof, daughter of Gullop, to ask if she had any books but instead she said she had a burlap sack that produces a potato every morning. She says Lady Mucklemoss is very rich.

Lady Mucklemoss is beautiful. She a crown of flowers and some unique markings. We approach while she is talking to someone who has frog faces on her shoulders. It is duchess Vlonk.

The stables have large frogs that the bullywog ride.

Kadayif turned into a lizard to investigate the tunnels. Near the Salamancer's office, there are two vials. One is labeled "Feymorian spit, do not drink". The other says "Giant frog hallucinogens"

Kadayif also searched Gullop's room. There were some gems, a cool ball-and-cup toy, and a conch shell that sounds like people laughing.

Kadayif then searched Mucklemoss' room. She has a painting of Gullop and alist of people she has bought gifts for. A note that Vlonk wants a promotion beyond the stables. There is one book in the room. The book is an unmarked diary. She wants to be the queen. He's been considering a marriage out of necessary. She really wants to ride a balloon.

Then Kadayif searched the Princesses room. She has a living room that could receive visitors. Her shelf has a pinecone made of silver, a piano with keys made from satyr horns. SHe also has a tiny cauldron. A book of fairy tales. Her diary says that someone traded something to Bavlorna and then afterwards was able to teach her Prestidigitation.

Kadayif then moved on to the Duchess of the Algae Bloom's room. The Duchess is in her room mumbling to herself. She is deciding whether or not to go to the party. She's mad she didn't get invited.

Alexandra talked to Mucklemoss about why Duchess of Algae Bloom wasn't invited. Alexandra convinced Mucklemoss to invite the Duchess. This worked to get the Duchess out of her room so that Kadayif could investigate it as a lizard.

Vlonk implies Duke Ickrind was kicked in the head by a giant frog.

The Duchess of Algae Bloom's room has small furniture and no Big Book. This room is a mess. She has a cup of mildew. She has a large shard glass like a mirror. A small decorative statue of a frog and a teapot.

We then talked to the Duchess at the party. She's not happy with her title.

The party wraps up and we take to our quarters.

<hr>

We take to our quarters which are fairly nice. There is a hottub/conversation pit.

We left for the stables. On the way we found a unattended rowboat which we needed to get to the stable.

The stable is large enough to store around two dozen giant toads. Inside I hear muttering in a Downfall accent and a hand-bell. Then I heard a giant wet slurp.

I just went in and found someone flailing in the mouth of a Giant frog. He indicated that he wanted help getting out. The person is Lady Vlonk.

She claims she is playing a game with "Swampbiscuit" the giant frog. Swampbiscuit is a giant frog. "Lightning" is the fastest, Patches is known for his beautiful worts. "Frisky-joe", "Ginki's", "Picklerick", "Peanut-hamper", et al. Some of the stables have toys and puzzles. They sit as little loafs like cats when they are sleeping.

Kadayif sneaks around as a lizard but Frisky-Joe tried to eat her. She convinced him it was a fun trick and Frisky-Joe seemed excited to play with her. Vlonk says he's a good boy who is nice to ride. Kadayif gets Vlonk to show her how the frogs swim. The frogs are graceful and fast swimmers.

Kadayif spots not froggy-people swimming under the surface. The scatter when spotted.

Alexandra and I searched the stables while Vlonk was occupied. Swampbiscuit is out of his stable.

We got Oroonoko to ring the bell to get Swampbiscuit to swallow him so that he could grab the book in. But then we all failed to extract him until Vlonk and Oswald worked together to pull Oroonoko out. Oroonoko pulled out the book.

To trade for Frisky-Joe with Vlonk we need to help her assassinate Gullop by distracting his knights so they won't be able to pull him out of Swampbiscuit.

On our way back to our suite, we spotted a large cauldron. I tried to open it with my mind, but it scuttled away. Out of the coals, a magmaman emerged and told us the brew is a spell of Polymorph that Bavlorna is brewing. He knows the password for the lid, but needs dry wood.

Kadayif traded a bunch of cinnamon sticks for the password "Spittlespew". We collected a jars of the juice for each of us and then tipped over the cauldron into the water. I tried it and it turned me into a giant frog.

We read the BBBBB. Bavlorna was mad that Skabatha Nightshade didn't attend her party even though it was close to Skabatha. Bavlorna doesn't seem to like the other hags.  

While we sleeping, the rock person, Ignatius, knocks on the door and asks if he should get involved in the plot to be dropped on Gullop. We gave him an iron toenail to help us escape.

The next day we went to the market. A big black balloon floats over the lake, a black basket hanging below it
The balloon is a roiling raincloud. Fair fairs

Two creatures are behind the counter. They are very grey and fey. Sinister looking. Kadayif recognizes them as Darklings.

Darklings are seely fey who wronged the Summer Queen. She cursed all of them. They dwell in dark caverns and dungeons. Ply their trade as thieves and killers.

Available items:
- Very good thimble
- Mug of Bumble Beer
- Duskmallow Pie
- Bundle of Dry Wood
- Ink Portraits
- Moonlight monocle (Kadayif traded opaque glasses for it and gave it to Oswald)
- Unicorn Horn
- Dagger
- Tank of Compressed Swamp Gas (Traded for my old name. My new name is Pytchley Pultusk)
- Book of Magic

On the way out, we ran into Mucklemoss who seemed surprised we survived the hottub.

<hr>

The plan for this session is to go right into the jailbreak.

The proving ground is muddy area that people have stomped flat. Small bleachers.

The fight is scheduled to happen at noon.

The prison is a sturdy wooden hut with two holding cells in the back. The bars are thick mangrove roots. There is a single guard mocking Morgort.

Alexandra tried to talk him into leaving the jail to put down the tree but he was too scared of the tree.

Kadayif mentally communicated with Morgort, who had a terrible escape plan that involved getting stabbed and then playing dead.

So Oswald and I convinced the guard to leave where Alexandra then unlocked the cage with her special bell of unlocking.

Morgort Tell us to be afraid of Bavlorna. An alarm was raised but we didn't investigate, choosing to row a boat to Bavlorna's hut.

We took a short rest on the boat. We saw the balloon take off. I doesn't look like it's being well driven. Something fell out of the balloon.

Under the stilts of the house we can see a well that goes up into the house.

Kadayif cast Pass Without Trace on us. I climbed down the well with spiderclimb and a cap of waterbreathing. Searched the floor of the lake and found 3 gold rings with my feet. There was a dead merrow experiment on the floor.   

I think ascended the well and my skin began to feel tingly. The water is getting acidic. Sometimes things are acidic.       

I ran into a gelatinous cube in the well, it attacked me and so I ran away.

We went through unlocked trap door instead where there is a pool in the middle of the room. Almost every service is covered in dirty and broken dishes.

We looked at a group of dressing mannequins. One has a black pointed hat.

We searched a fabric room with two human shaped pin cushions (voo-doo dolls). One is riding a little rocking horse and the other has wooden wings that look mechanical. A lot of the pins in the one on the horse are in the back. On the other, the pins are all over but a lot are concentrated on the eyes.

We found a room with a large cupboard. There is a silver hourglass sigil, of the hourglass coven. I opened it with my mind.

It opens by turning the hourglass upside down. Rows of small compartments. On has a mini cauldron with a little note saying "Spittlespew". There are love-letters, not sent to Bavlorna. Little trinkets of marginal value.

The patio is covered in little regular-looking frogs.

The final room is where Bavlorna mends beings together. I opened up a crate in the corner that has a dead basilisk in it.    

We can't hear anything from below so we go up the spiral staircase going counter-clockwise. It leads into dank hallway with portraits of grumpy or unhappy people. The frames are nice. There is a framed mirror as well on the wall. One of the portraits is of Octavian.

Alexandra looks through the mirror and sees herself but seems more neutral.

We looked into the guest bedroom. In it are shadowboxes. They have mummified pixies except for one which is broken open.

A dining room as well. It has two exits. There are two goblin heads mounted on the wall. There are six chairs on either side of a table. Nothing of interest in the cupboards.  

Another room has a strange contraption with tubes and metal containers and buckets. A work table has bits of copper and metalworking tools. It is distilling equipment for collecting stinky alcohol. The still is on the brink of falling apart. The hopper is filled with mushrooms. Kadayif snapped a ring off the machine. It looks like a umbrella for pixies.

We went into a large room with bloodstains. A gore splattered kitchen. A stout figure with armor chases vultures away from a butchers block. The small figure is the red-cap from my vision.

Her name is Bloody-toes and she's the chef. She says the heart from my vision powers the freezer. She says the heart belongs to a sad-sack elf who was cold-hearted. She shows us the meat locker.      

The meat locker has meat and a chest with the heart in it.

Bloody-toes says there's a room with a wasps nest in it.

The checked out a balcony on the second floor. Three large cages are hanging off. In one is a naked Vansle. He is pleased to see us. Brigands put him here after he lost everything in cards.     

We brought him over to the balcony and freed him.   

We checked out a pantry that contained, amoung otehr things, a campestri (a happy mushroom) in a jar. It signals that is not okay and wants to get out. It sings when it we open the jar. We took it and left a mushroom that makes people look old.

From the other side of a door, we heard two voices being catty about a play. We opened that door and found two figures drinking tea. One is a tall thin woman of dark complexion. She looks like the type of creature that were the merchants. There is a another set of stairs.

The other creature has bulging eyes, with gaping mouth that flies fly in and out of. There are two lornlings attached to her. The room is filthy. She has Kadayif's things but not anyone else's.


Kadayif notices the not-Bavlorna (Charm) woman doesn't cast a shadow. Kadayif proposes a trade. Bavlorna proposes we do 3 small chores to get her to be willing to bargain.
- Clearing the well   
- Returning the book   
- A package of hers, the animal carcasses   

Instead Kadayif turned into a Moose and charged her so we fought it.

Skabatha has a portrait of herself in her stronghold. Bavlorna wants the Skabatha portrait. Endolyn and Tasha. She gives us a portal bag of holding to send the portait back so we don't have to return here.

<hr>

Bavlorna wants someone to clear out her pool.

She has a staff with mirrors dangling from it. She takes one of the mirrors off and sees in it, the elven couple from the bar. She thinks they will clean out her pool. Elim the woman and male Torkal from Amn.

Someone comes down the stairs in this room. It's just a shadow. Charm stares at the shadow. Charm leaves when the shadow approaches.

Charm is a sibling of the other Darklings who run the market. She is handed a spool of thread by her shadow.

Charm tells us we are mortals and we can break deals. She also tells us that what Kadayif is missing is a pipe.  

She was here stealing that spools of thread that is the color of frustrated.

Endolyn Moongrave is the youngest and most precocious of the sisters. Motherhorn is in Yon and is a nice theatre that has new plays every day.

Elim and Torkal arrived after we rested. They told us about their journey where they ran into king Illig.

They made a deal with Bavlorna for something in exchange for clearing the blockage in the pool. We helped them kill the gelatinous cube.

Kadayif turned into a Giant Wolf Spider to climb up to the third floor and lowered a rope down to the balcony on the second floor for us to climb up.

As Kadayif came into the room there is a single dying lorning. It died shortly after Kadayif entered.

There is a squat chest of drawers and stocky chest with an iron padlock.

I picked the chest open but then the floating light attacked. I burned it to death.

Inside the chest is a marionette and an unpunched ticket to the Witchlight carnival Isolde and three scrolls of identify.

The squat cabinet has 4 withered potted plants on top of it. All of the clothes are sized for Bavlorna. I righted the plants and watered them. They look evil and like the big tree outside. Being watered, it gave me a key wrapped in a poem. The key is for the chest. The first letter of each line spells "FROGMOUTH".

The next room is a storeroom. Mostly junk but a white porcelin jar using chicken legs to stand. A fancy helmet on faceless wooden mannequin. A 4ft bronze frog, it's mouth open and but impenetrability dark.

Kadayif reached straight into the frogmouth, said the name of the thing she lost and retrieved a strange pipe. Blowing into it, it produced music and pictures of any animal you choose. The pictures and extremely detailed.

Kadayif feels whole again and she sings a wonderful song.

We identified the helmet on the mannequin as a helm of telepathy.

We also got a hint from a broken wishbone. "Skabatha forgets the first creatures she sees when she wakes up, although her memory of it returns each night when she sleeps. A creature forgotten by Skabatha in this manner is invisible to her."

I terrorized Oroonoko by telling him the Polymorphed party members are giant frogs.

We met up with Morgort.

Clapperclaw relayed news to us. Vlonk got eaten by a giant frog. Duke Ickrind missed with rocks and the loss of ballast sent him away.

We take off in the swamp balloon with Clapperclaw and Morgort to Thither. We didn't see any air elementals.

On the way we spotted a flying snake dragon. It's the Jabberwock. We descended as fast as we could but that was into a forest. We all stayed in the basket.

We are in Thither.

<hr>

There is a different twilight here. The jabberwock is distracted by the balloon so we left. We hear a river but no birds.

Clapperclaw was created by Skabatha here in Thither. Skabatha lives in a big fallen tree in Loomlurch. Loomlurch was a treant before Skabatha had him felled.

One of the trees has a wanted poster of a kid with things to steal.
```
Wanted!!!
Will of the Feywild.
Special offer!
Bring this impetuous brat to me and you claim one item of you choice from my workshop.
- Granny Nightshade
```

Little Oak is a treant. One of the only treants.


As we travel, two goblins drive a cart labeled "Gordle and Dibbs’ Fine Confections". It is driven by an angry mule. The two are looking to win a candy competition. They are rivals with a owl-fairy. She's been getting secret ingredients from Oliver.

They have
- Amber hard candy with a beetle encased inside.
- A lolipop made out of ants
- Jellied worms in a little jar
- Chocolate that takes like pickle


We keep came to the river and followed it inland. Another poster for Will of the Feywild proclaims his live return to Skabatha will earn 10 years of youth.

Out from webbed holes in ground, three clockwork burrowing spiders jumped out and attacked us. They were not made by skilled experts. In one of the burrows is a mummified goblin.

Another poster promises the heart of someone you love for returning the Will of the Feywild.

Suddenly squirrels start chittering a warning before vines burst up from the ground, entangling Alexandra and I.

A small goblin makes herself seen. She calls us Mercenaries. But tells us we have her friends. We convinced her that we were kidnappers for Skabatha. Her name is Squeakity-squeak.

She talks to the squirrels. Alexandra learns from the squirrels that Skabatha is cutting down trees to turn into toys at her workshop. Some of the trees contained dryads.

Skabatha has children make wind up toys for her. Some of Zybilna's magic remains that protects them from attacks.

Will and the Getaway Gang live in Little Oak.

Boggles are sadness brought into being.

There are some refugees on the floating islands. Terrace town is a goblin cities. Unicorns are rumored here.

We need to take the mushroom to a fairy circle. The fairy circles are used for teleportation. Some of them are activated with a rhyme, some need the full moon.

Fire is effective against ettercaps.

<hr>

Consider finding Little Oak.
