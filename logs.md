# Day 1
Four of them were invited to the pumpkin farm house of Madryck. An old man. The house is made out of a house sized pumpkin. The house is cozy. Zybilna is his patron and Madryck knows that these four have lost something at the carnival. He has lost contact with Zybilna. Madryck wants them to find someone named Prismir stuck in the feywild.
Zybilna is an archfey, which is considered a fairy godmother among her followers. Casimir claims to have met her. Alexandra has a book that speaks to Zybilna. Kadayif is strange. Oswald does not know what could be dangerous about the feywild.
Normally Madryck would communicate with Zybilna about the safety of the feywild.
Madryck summoned a carrige for them to take them to the carnival. Fey don't accept gold currency so to speak. The carrige is carved from a pumpkin but not slimy inside.
The carnival's owners are from shadowfell.

Meanwhile, at sunset, I am in a flying carriage as part
Pineham and someone have sent me a letter.
Pineham's letter let me know that my niece lost her tooth. Penelope feels like she is indebted to the tooth-fairy.
The other letter is looking for my help.

Mr. Witch and Mr. Light pull up next to my trailer. Mr. Witch wants my help. He invites me into his and Mr. Light's trailer and asks for my discretion. The two have been having problems with a disgruntled female Kenku guest. She's been using disguises and learned to recognize our security. She has been sabotaging rides and generally ruining guests' experiences. Mr. Light wants Oroonoko and I to blend in and attempt to intercept the kenku guest. He also wants us to not tell anyone about it.  
Thaco came by while Oroonoko and I were preparing to enter the carnival and told me that Palasha and Candlefoot has split up after she proposed. Oroonoko and I waited around the entrance to the park keeping an eye out for groups of four.

Just before the dawn, a Witchlight monarch will be appointed to the person who has contributed the most to the carnival.

There is a new attraction, the lightning dome, where guests can safely fight demons. It is near the entrance.

I caught one of the welcome gifts. Eventually I spotted a group of four travelers and introduced myself by asking if they recognize the Madryck Roslof. They did and I am assisting them. I told them about the Mystery Mine. Zephixo the dwarf runs this.
There is a rail line with carts with seats for 8. We are riding the carts with another couple. The rail line goes into a dragon mouth. Inside their were visions of snakes everywhere! There was also a vision of Alexandra's son dressed as a town guard. Suddenly, I'm in my underwear and everyone is laughing at me, it's terrifying. Then a couple of thugs, ordered by a stately dressed woman to attack us. One more vision appears. The shadow of a woman, dressed as an acrobat. Lights on the ride go out and people scream. Zephixo yells "It's not supposed to do this, I'll try rebooting it". He also recommends Tasha's Fortuneteller.

The booth is a wooden, mechanical dummy. Tasha is a witch-queen who wrote the Demonomicon. Fortune-telling is out of character for her. A halfling couple, in front of us, proposes and the recipient starting rolling on the ground laughing. The proposer ran into the nearby hall of illusions to hide out of embarrassment. Kadayif discovered that perhaps the proposee was magically induced to laugh. Inside the hall of illusions is a series of mirrors which initially reflect our childlike appearances. Later in the maze, our reflections get older. We found the proposer looking at a mirror with a little girl in a pig-mask looking back at him. The proposer is named Rueben. Eventually they meet back up outside the hall and make amends.
With that complete, we all approached the booth to get a fortune but fell under a laughing spell. Still got a fortune though: an embossed card "Scabbatha Nightshade and can't remember the first creature she sees when she wakes up"

After we all got our weird fortunes we headed towards the lost property booth to look for the things we have lost. We met Dirlagraun outside the lost property. Dirlagraun loves children and children love playing with her. One child runs away.

We chased the child and spotted the girl in the pig-mask. She says her name is Sow-pig. Her skin is cold and blue-grey. She says "I can't take anything from you, you've got a ticket."

Back at lost-and-found, Dirlagraun apologizes for spooking the child who ran. The child had picked up a ball that belonged to her lost child, Star. We told her that we would help find Star in the feywild.
<hr>

Next stop Calliope. A goblin dressed as a ladybug shakes a cup at us. Ernest the Monkey is playing the instrument. I and Oswald gave him buttons. The Calliope plays music that reflects the mood of the carnival. Ernest is in the body of his trained monkey Bubbles. Bubbles has the body. The body may be balding. Suddenly the Calliope starts playing discordant notes along with the regular notes. The discordant notes stop for a second and a person hiding in the shadows begins to run. I tripped them telekinetically and Oswald grabbed em. The target looks human but patting her down I felt feathers. It's the rebellious kenku who has been causing problems! She says she's on a mission to find her mission patron Zybilna. Her name is Kettlesteam. She wanted to cause a ruckus until the owners show her how to get to the feywild. We released her under the understanding that she would return after the big-top extravaganza.

We were on the way to the feasting grounds when we passed a commotion at the Carousel. Diana Cloppington the centaur, is complaining the Carousel won't stop. She's quite upset that she can't fit onto the ride. Diana told Alexandra that she made a deal with a hag to be reunited with her lost warhorse and that's how she ended up as a centaur. A few of us forced our way to the center of the Carousel and were able to stop the gear mechanism to stop the Carousel. Diana told us that the unicorns on the Carousel were made by a hag and have powers of divination. If we name the unicorns we can talk to them. Four of them are partially named. Alexandra immediately figured out their names and we started riding them. They whispered mysterious things at us. Mine whispered with Oswald "Scabbatha Nightshade, granny Nightshade to some. Has the things we seek, you must find her to get your things back. Her lair is a dead hollowed out tree in a sylvan forest. She's part of the hourglass coven with her sisters who she hates but needs." Diana tends to our wounds before we go.

We arrive a the feasting orchard. The trees have fruit. There is a fairycake eating contest going on. Craig from goblin wresting is competing as well. Alexandra won after beating me out by a single cupcake. Overall we ate more than 40 cupcakes.

After recovering from our cupcake feast, we went to the dragonfly rides. Northwind the treent told us that Thaco used to be a knife thrower and Mr. Light and Mr. Witch traded the carnival for something. A dwarf falls from his dragonfly during the ride but Casamir cast feather fall on the dwarf and landed softly on the ground. On the dragonfly, I noticed Kettlesteam by the dragonfly rides. I spotted the moon-masked woman/ghost again.

Next to the Gondola Swans. The swans are giant and pulling 8 person boats. The boat going slowly around the entire park. The swan asks if we are enjoying the "swandolas". Her name is Featherine. She told us about how sad it is that Candlefoot and Palasha broke up. Candlefoot hasn't spoken sense. Kadayif spotted the flog/girl/ghost.

<hr>
Be sure to fix Candlefoot's relationship for mirth points.

The Big Top Extravaganza is about to begin. As we headed over there Casamir ran into an elf wearing a poorly fitting suit. Tintagel is nervous about his first performance on the Big Top Extravaganza. Tintagel invites us into the dressing room. A thin elven man, Mr. Light, is wearing a suit of mirrors. Mr Light is concerned with performers dropping out. Mr Light. Burley is there too.
We signed up to fill in some of the acts by live acting Alexandra's fairy tails.
Oswald and I were in a unicorn costume riding a tandem bicycle.
Burly wants us to meet up after the performance.
The first performer did a very impressive fire-breathing act.
Next up was Candlefoot, a lanky mime. He does sleight of hand tricks and people enjoy it. He does copper-into-gold, coin-into-goldfish and goldfish-into-bigger-fish.
Tintagel goes next. Takes a rabbit out of a hat, and is very nervous. I volunteered to be sawed in half. It went flawlessly and Tintagel forgot to ask for a the potion of revivify he gave me back.
Bugbear lifts several people on a dumb-bell. He then does tug of war with Oswald and I.
Our performance went well.

Afterwards Burly says he'll lead us to Mr. Lights room to pick out payment in. Burly doesn't know where the entrance to the feywild is but thinks his brother is there. Burly says that if we stole Mr Witch's pocket-watch, we could force him to tell us how to get to the feywild. The easiest way to get close to Mr Witch is during the crowning of the Monarch. Dirlagraun could help us there.

Thaco is standing outside Mr. Light's room. Both Mr's are in the carriage claim not to know how to get to the feywild but Kadayif can tell they are lying.
They have
- [ ] Alchemy Jug
- [x] Hewards spice pouch (Kadayif)
- [ ] Self mending rope
- [ ] Tankard of sobriety
- [ ] A wand of wonder
- [x] Periapt (necklace) of wound closure (Oswald)
- [x] Bag of holding (used) (Pytchley)
- [x] Horseshoe of hold iron (Casimir)
- [x] Loaf of bread of breaking (Alexandra)
- [ ] Set of Mage Armor

Casimir managed to fool Mr Witch into give up his watch. We traded it back to him for information on how to get to the feywild. In front of a mirror in the hall of illusions, we must say
```
Hither, thither, here and there,
Wander yonder, show me where
```  

Thaco made us some impressive balloon animals. I gave my balloon to Oroonoko and gave him a pat on the back.

We went back to the Calliope and picked up a note from Kettlesteam who told us to meet at Silversong lake. Normally Palasha sings here.
Palasha sings a glorious haunting song. The song leads water to shapes rising from the water.
Kettlesteam heckled Palasha in Candlefoot's voice so we grabbed her again. She admitted to stealing Candlefoot's voice so we went to have her give Candlefoot his voice back. Meanwhile Alexandra and Casimir comforted Palasha.

At the hall of illusions, Kettlesteam returned Candlefoot's voice to him by giving him a cornhusk doll. Candlefoot is worried that Palasha won't forgive him.  

We dropped off Kettlesteam with Burley and Mr Witch. Burley kicks out Kettlesteam who says she won't come back tomorrow. Mr. Witch was still upset but I think he's happy.

We then reunited the voiced Candlefoot with Palasha. Candlefoot gave me an acting lesson in gratitude.

A strange severe woman customer, named Alissa, taps Casimir on the shoulder asking him to find her master's lady-love who is hiding out with her sisters in the fey-wild. She is
- the pretty sister
- Common is not her first language
- Has some elven ancestry
- She has crowsfeet around her eyes.
Her master will pay handsomely to know where she is. She gave Casimir a coin of a weird foreign currency. `Coin with an infinity symbol and an arrow pointing down from it on one side, a hand with 6 fingers on the other.`  

We went to the Snail races. Two goblins administer the races. I raced on Flowerflash but came in third. Kadayif won.
<hr>
We are going to the small stalls. We all did terribly at the Almiraj Ring Toss. We mostly outstared the Cyclops. At Catch the Dragon by the Tail, the dragon is named Applesauce. At the gnome poetry contest I nailed the poetry. Oswald bested the goblin who has been needling him in the wrestling match. I guessed the right number of feathers on the Cockatrice Lula.
There is an Aladrin at the prize table. There are circlets of fey-kind which will daily make us more-resemble fey. We took our prizes.

We then went the the lightning dome and prepped for a fight. After three rounds we defeated a scary clown.

Next on the trip is the Bubble-pop Teapot. There are a bunch of goblins drinking tea. Treaclwise is the ride manager. The goblins are talking in non-sense.
```The Baked Bean's skin and blisters came to visit. Now there's no Frog and Toad to the palace, just ball and chalk.
The dustbin lids with no bread and honey get a half-inch from the three tea leaves of the skins and blisters.
```
