# Letter from Madryck
```
Greetings to the Inventive Mr. Pultusk,
    Though we do not know each other, I am convinced you are someone who can help me with a matter of great importance to me, and to you, also. In the spirit of reciprocity, if you can assist me in this matter, I offer you the riches of my adventuring career. If that’s not enticing, I offer you the chance to gain information on a unique item… something of interest to you. Something you once possessed and now miss terribly. Four travelers will arrive at the carnival tonight, please assist them in their mission. It should become evident what your interest in it is, both for yourself and your home.

Sincerely,
Madryck Roslof
